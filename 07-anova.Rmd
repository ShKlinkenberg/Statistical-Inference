# Moderation with Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) {#anova}
> Key concepts: between groups variance, within groups variance, homogeneous population variances, capitalization on chance, post-hoc tests, main effects, interaction effects, moderation, predictor, moderator,

If we want to compare the level of outcome scores among more than two groups, we may use analysis of variance. Analysis of variance does not produce confidence intervals; it is purely a statistical test.

The null hypothesis tested in analysis of variance states that all groups have the same average outcome scores in the population. This null hypothesis is similar to the one we test in an independent-samples t test for two groups. With three or more groups, we must use the variance of the group means (between groups variance) to test the null hypothesis. If the between groups variance is zero, all group means must be equal.

In addition to the between groups variance, we have to take into account the variance of outcome scores within groups (within group variance). Within group variance is linked to random group mean differences that we may expect in random samples. The ratio of between groups variance over within groups variance gives us the F test statistic, which has an F distribution.

Differences in average outcome scores for groups on one predictor variable (factor) are called a main effect. A main effect represents an overall or average effect of a factor. If we have only one factor in our model, we apply a one-way analysis of variance. With two factors, we have a two-way analysis of variance, and so on.

With two or more factors, we can have interaction effects in addition to main effects. An interaction effect is the joint effect of two or more factors on the outcome variable. A joint effect is best understood as different effects of one factor for different groups on another factor. This is called moderation and we usually think of one factor as the predictor and another factor as the moderator. The moderator changes the effect of the predictor on the outcome.

```

1. what is or are the main effects in Figure \@ref(fig:anova-overview)? Explain how you can recognize main effects both in the means plot and in the reported numbers.
```{r eval=FALSE}
* There are two factors as we can see in the table:
endorser (columns) and sex (rows). Each factor has a
main effect, so there are two main effects in this example.
* A main effect exists if the groups on one predictor
(factor) have unequal means.
* In right-most column of the table, it is easy to see 
that females have a higher average willingness score than
males, so there is a main effect of sex.
* The average scores for the three endorsers are also
quite clearly different (bottom row of the table).
* In the plot, the difference is more difficult to see.
You have to guess the average score of females over all
endorsers (the average of the red line) and the average
score of all males (average of the blue line), to see
that females score higher than males on average.
* In addition, we have to guess the average score for an
endorser from the plot. This is somewhere in the middle
of the green arc linking the score of females to the score
of males. The average score with Clooney as endorser seems
to be higher than the average score without a celebrity
endorser, and the average score for Angelina Jolie is highest.
These differences indicate a main effect for endorser.
```

2. Change some group means to create substantial and statistically significant moderation of the effect of endorser (Nobody, Clooney, or Jolie) on willingness.
```{r eval=FALSE}
* Moderation means different differences. This is best
seen in the plot. The green arcs represent the differences
between average willingness of males and females. If the
green arcs are not equally long or point in opposite
directions, the differences between females and males are
not the same for all endorsers.
* In this case, sex moderates the effect of endorser on
willingness or, equivalently, endorser moderates the effect
of sex on willingness.
```

3. What is the null hypothesis of the F tests reported in Figure \@ref(fig:anova-overview)?
```{r eval=FALSE}
* The substantive null hypothesis of an F test in analysis
of variance is that all groups have the same average outcome
scores in the populations from which the samples were drawn.
* For the main effect of sex, the null hypotheses
are that females and males have the same average willingness
in the population
* The null hypothesis for the main effect of endorser is that
subjects exposed to Clooney, Jolie, or no celebrity endorser
have the same average willingness in the population.
* The null hypothesis of an F test on an interaction effect
states that the subgroups have the same population averages
if we correct for the main effects. In this example, the
null hypothesis is that all combinations of sex and 
endorser have the same average willingness in the population
if we correct for the main effects.
* This can also be expressed as: The differences in average
population willingness between females and males are the same
for all endorsers.
```

4. How should we interpret the eta^2^ values in Figure \@ref(fig:anova-overview)?
```{r eval=FALSE}
* Eta^2 gives the proportion of variance in the outcome
variable that is predicted or explained by the factor
(categorical predictor variable).
* When the app is just loaded, eta^2 for the endorser
effect is 0.47. The differences between subjects'
willingness scores in the sample can be predicted for
47 percent by the endorser that they were exposed to.
```

## Different Score Levels for Three or More Groups

Celebrity endorsement theory states that celebrities who publicly state that they favour a product, candidate, or cause, help to persuade consumers to adopt or support the product, candidate, or cause [for a review, see @RefWorks:3940; for an alternative approach, see @RefWorks:3941]. Imagine that we want to test if the celebrity who endorses a fund raiser in a fund-raising campaign makes a difference to people's willingness to donate. We will be using the celebrities George Clooney and Angelina Jolie, and we will compare campaigns with one of them to a campaign without celebrity endorsement.

```{r clooneyjolie, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.cap="George Clooney and Angelina Jolie."}
# Include portraits: Clooney, Jolie.
knitr::include_graphics("figures/ClooneyJolie.png")
```

Let us design an experiment to investigate the effects of celebrity endorsement. We sample a number of people (subjects), whom we assign randomly to one of three groups. We show a campaign video with George Clooney to one group, a video with Angelina Jolie to another group, and the third group---the control group---sees a campaign  video without celebrity endorsement. So we have three experimental conditions (Clooney, Jolie, no endorser) as our predictor variable. 

Our outcome is a numeric scale assessing the subject's willingness to donate to the fund raiser on a scale from 1 ("absolutely certain that I will not donate") to 10 ("absolutely certain that I will donate"). We will compare the average outcome scores among groups. If groups with Clooney or Jolie as endorser have systematically higher average willingness to donate than the group without celebrity endorsement, we conclude that celebrity endorsement has a positive effect.

In statistical terminology, we have a categorical predictor and a numerical outcome. In experiments, we usually have a very limited set of treatment levels, so our predictor is categorical. For nuanced results, we usually want to have a numeric outcome. Analysis of variance was developed for this kind of data, so it is widely used in the context of experiments. Note, however, that it can also be used in non-experimental situations as long as the predictor is categorical and the outcome numeric.

### Mean differences as effects {#anova-meandiffs}
```{r anova-means, fig.cap="How do group means relate to effect size?"}
# Goal: Illustrate that differences between group means represent effects (effect size given by eta^2).
# Generate 4 random observations from a normally distributed population with mean 6.4, sd = 1 (Clooney), 4 observations from a population N(m = 6.8, sd = 1) (Jolie), and 4 observations from N(m = 3.3, sd = 1) (no endorser). Use colour for the treatment factor (3 levels). Represent observations in a dotplot, each with a separate value on the x axis, clustered by factor level (experimental condition). Display group means as horizontal line segments (coloured by factor level). Add vertical double-sided arcs between each pair of group means to illustrate group differences. Display eta^2 for the data. Allow user to change the group means and update the plot, mean (difference) lines, and eta^2.
```

1. In the sample of (12) subjects displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:anova-means), what do the double-sided vertical arcs represent?

2. How do the double-sided vertical arcs relate to effect size (eta^2^)? Explain the relation in your own words and change group means to verify your expectations.

Average outcome score for a group represents a group's score level. The exact score level for a group, for example, the average willingness to donate for subjects who have seen George Clooney endorse the fund raiser, depends on all kinds of causes. The level itself is not of much interest to us. Instead, we focus on the differences between the score levels of groups. 

Random assignment of test subjects to experimental groups is meant to create groups that are equal on all imaginable characteristics except the experimental treatment(s) administered by the researcher to the subjects. If this was done successfully, differences between group score levels can only be caused by the experimental treatment. Mean differences are said to represent the effect of experimental treatment in analysis of variance.

Analysis of variance was developed for the analysis of experiments, where effects can be interpreted as causal effects. Note, however, that analysis of variance can also be applied to non-experimental data. Although mean differences are still called effects in the latter type of analysis, these need not be causal effects.

In analysis of variance, then, we are simply interested in the differences between group means. The conclusion for a sample is easy: Which groups have higher average score on the outcome variable and for which are they lower? A simple means plot, such as Figure \@ref(fig:anova-meansplot), aids interpretation and helps communicating results to the reader. 

```{r anova-meansplot, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A means plot showing that average willingness to donate is higher with a celebrity endorser than without a celebrity endorser.", out.width="70%"}
# Insert means plot for celebrity endorsement example.
d <- data.frame(endorser = factor(c("Nobody","Clooney","Jolie"), levels = c("Nobody","Clooney","Jolie")), willingness_av = c(3, 6, 7), const = 1)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(d, aes(endorser, willingness_av)) + geom_point() + geom_line(aes(group = const)) + theme_general() + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(1, 10), breaks = c(1, 5, 10)) + labs(x = "Endorser", y = "Average willingness to donate")
rm(d)
```

Effect size in an analysis of variance refers to the overall differences between group means. We use eta^2^ as effect size, which gives the proportion of variance in the outcome (willingness to donate) explained or predicted by the group variable (experimental condition).

Rules of thumb for the interpretation of eta^2^: 

* 0,01 = small or weak effect; 1% variance explained matches a correlation r = 0,10 because R^2^ in simple regression analysis equals r squared,

*	0,09 = medium-sized or moderate effect, matches r = 0,30,
*	0,25 = large or strong effect; matches r = 0,50.

### Between groups variance {#between-variance}
```{r anova-between, fig.cap="Which part of score differences tell us about the differences between groups?", echo=FALSE, screenshot.opts = list(delay = 5), dev="png", out.width="540px"}
# Goal: Illustrate that between groups variance represents differences between group means and the grand mean. And that it is a (smaller or larger) proportion of total variance.
# App anova-means: Generate 4 random observations from a normally distributed population with mean 6.4, sd = 1 (Clooney), 4 observations from a population N(m = 6.8, sd = 1) (Jolie), and 4 observations from N(m = 3.3, sd = 1) (no endorser). Use colour for the treatment factor (3 levels). Represent observations in a dotplot, each with a separate value on the x axis, clustered by factor level (experimental condition). Display group means as horizontal line segments (coloured by factor level). Display eta^2 for the data. Allow user to change the group means and update the plot, mean (difference) lines, and eta^2.
# Extension/replacement: Add horizontal line for grand mean, vertical red solid double-sided arcs between each observation and the grand mean (total variance), vertical black solid double-sided arcs for each observation between its group mean and the grand mean (between variance), and vertical black dotted double-sided arcs for each observation between the dot and its group mean (within variance). 
knitr::include_app("http://82.196.4.233:3838/apps/anova-between/", height="530px")
```

1. In Figure \@ref(fig:anova-between), what do the solid red arcs represent?
```{r, eval=FALSE}
1. The solid red arcs represent the difference between an individual score 
and the average score of the group to which the individual belongs.
For example, the left-most orange dot represents the willigness score of
a subject who was exposed to Clooney as endorser. The orange line
represents the average willignness score of the subjects who were
exposed to Clooney. The dotted red arc is the difference between the
individual's willingness score and the mean score of it's group.
```

2. What do the solid black arcs represent?
```{r, eval=FALSE}
2. The solid black arcs represent the difference between an individual's
group score, for example, the average willingness score of all subjects
who were exposed to Clooney, and the average score of all subjects (the
grand or overall mean).
```

3. What do the dotted black arcs in Figure \@ref(fig:anova-between) represent?
```{r eval=FALSE}
3. The dotted black arcs represent the difference between individual
willingness scores and the average willingness scores of all subjects.
The represent the overall variance (or standard devation).
```

4. Which arcs relate directly to effect size eta^2^? Change group means (and press the _Update graph_ button) to verify your expectation.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
4. The solid black arcs relate to eta2. Eta2 is larger if the
differences between the group means are larger. The solid black
arcs express these differences.
If you decrease the differences between the group means, eta2
decreases and the solid black arcs become smaller. The red arcs
(differences between scores and their group means) remain the
same (but note that the vertical scale of the graph may change,
so the red arcs may seem to increase or decrease a little). 
The dotted black arcs change but some become longer (and others
become shorter) if you decrease the differences between the 
group means, so the dotted black arcs are not so clearly 
related to eta2.
```

What does it mean if we say that a percentage of the variance is explained when we interpret eta^2^? The variance that we want to explain consists of the differences between the scores of the subjects on the outcome variable and the overall or grand mean of all outcome scores. The dotted black arcs Figure \@ref(fig:anova-between) express the distances between outcome scores and the grand average. Squaring and averaging these distances over all observations gives us the variance in outcome scores.

Why do some subjects have above average willingness to donate and other subjects below average willingness? We want to explain the variation in willingness from the experimental treatment of the subjects: Which endorser are the subjects exposed to? If an endorser is more effective, the overall level of willingness should be higher. In other words, the average willingness should be higher for subjects confronted with this endorser.

So group average willingness is what we can predict from the experimental treatment. If we know the group to which a subject belongs---which celebrity she saw endorsing the fundraising campaign---we can use the average outcome score for the group as the predicted outcome for each group member---her willingness to donate. The predicted group scores are represented by the horizontal lines for group means in Figure \@ref(fig:anova-between).

Now what part of the variance in outcome scores (dotted black arcs in Figure \@ref(fig:anova-between)) is explained by the predicted values, that is, group means? It is the variance of the predicted scores, which is the average (squared) distance between the group mean and the grand mean for all observations. This is called the _between groups variance_ and it is represented by the solid black arcs in Figure \@ref(fig:anova-between).

Playing with the group means in Figure \@ref(fig:anova-between), you may have noticed that eta^2^ is high if there are large differences between group means. In this situation we have high between groups variance---large black arcs in Figure  \@ref(fig:anova-between)---so we can predict a lot of the variation in outcome scores between subjects. 

In contrast, small differences between group averages allow us to predict only a small part of the variation in outcome scores. If all group means are equal, we can predict none of the variation in outcome scores because the between groups variance is zero. As we will see in Section \@ref(anova-model), zero between groups variance is central to the null hypothesis in analysis of variance.

### Within groups variance {#within-variance}
```{r anova-within, fig.cap="How does within group variance relate to between groups variance?"}
# Goal: Sensitize students to the fact that larger population variance creates larger random variance of sample means.
# 3 populations (of willingness to donate scores; arranged vertically, so means can easily be compared) with equal means and variances (N(5.2, 2)?) ; add button to draw a random sample from all three populations (N = 10 per sample) and display as (3 vertically arranged) dotplots ; display the mean (vertical line) and the variance as a number within each plot ; calculate and display the between groups variance of the three sample means ; allow user to change the population variance (range: [0, 8], initially 2) to see how it relates to random between groups variance
```

1. In Figure \@ref(fig:anova-within), samples are drawn from three populations that have the same means and variances. Do the samples have the same means?

2. How does between groups variance in the samples relate to the variance in the populations?

3. What happens if you set population variance to zero in Figure \@ref(fig:anova-within)?

4. What, do you expect, is within group variance in Figure \@ref(fig:anova-within)?

If we draw samples from the same population or from populations with the same means, the sample means can still be different because we draw samples at random. These sample mean differences are due to chance, they do not reflect true differences between the populations.

Random samples from the same population can only have different sample means if there is variation in the population scores. After all, if all people exposed to George Clooney as endorser would have exactly the same willingness to donate, every random sample drawn from these people would contain people with exactly the same willingness to donate. Average willingness can only be exactly the same for all samples.

The variation in scores within a population, for example, all people who would be exposed to George Clooney as endorser, is called _within group variance_. Within groups variance gives rise to chance differences between means of sample drawn from the same or identical population.

The amount of variation in population scores is important. Chance differences between sample means are more likely to be larger if within group variance is larger. You are more likely to draw some observations far away from the population mean if score variation is larger in the population. Observations far from the mean influence the sample mean strongly, so the means of samples drawn from this population fluctuate more.

Within group variance in outcome scores is what we cannot predict with our grouping variable; it is prediction error. In some SPSS output, t is therefore labeled as "Error". After all, each member of the same group has the same predicted score, namely the group average. Within groups variance in a sample is represented by the dotted double-sided arcs in Figure \@ref(fig:anova-between).

### F test on the model {#anova-model}

Average group scores tell us whether the experimental treatment has effects within the sample(s) (Section \@ref(anova-meandiffs)). If the group who saw Angelina Jolie as endorser has higher average willingness to donate than the group who did not see an endorser, we conclude that Angelina Jolie makes a difference in the sample. But how about the population?

#### Test statistic
```{r anova-F}
# Goal: Illustrate that between groups variance is zero for equal group means and that it increases with larger (population) differences between group means.
# Generate a sample (N = 12) and plot it as in the app anova-between. Include lines (line segments) for grand mean and group means but do not include double-sided arcs. Display between groups variance instead of eta^2 as a value. Allow users to change the three group means. Adjust current plots and betweengroups variance but don't draw a new sample. 
```

1. In which situation is between groups variance zero? Adjust the group means in Figure \@ref(fig:anova-F) to check your answer.

If we want to test whether the difference also applies to the population, we use the substantive null hypothesis that all average outcome scores are equal in the populations from which the samples were drawn. In our example, the null hypothesis states that people who would see George Clooney as endorser are just as willing to donate as people who would see Angelina Jolie or who would not see a celebrity endorser at all.

A statistical test requires a single number that expresses how close the sample result is to the hypothesis. How can we express the equality of three or more population means in one number?

In an independent-samples t test (Section \@ref(fig:level-differences)), it was easy to express the equality of the two group means as one number: Just take the difference of the two means. Subtraction, however, does not work for three or more groups.

It is easy to see that subtraction of three means may yield zero even if the means are not the same. Assume that the Clooney group scores 6 as average willingness to donate, the Jolie group scores 4, and the group without celebrity endorser score 2. If we subtract in this order, the result is 6 - 4 - 2 = 0. But the differences between means is not zero!

Instead of subtraction, we use the variation in group means as the number to express the size of differences between group means. If all groups have the same average outcome score, the variance is zero. The larger the differences, the larger the variance. But wait, this is the between groups variance that we have encountered before (Section \@ref(between-variance))!

#### Chance differences in samples

```{r anova-Fratio}
# Goal: Sensitize student to importance of ratio between groups over within groups variance for rejecting the null hypothesis of equal population means.
# Generate a sample (N = 12) and plot it as in the app anova-F. Display between groups variance and within-groups varianceas a pie chart. Display the F and p values. Allow users to change both variances and adjust the dotplot and pie chart accordingly. 
```

1. How should you adjust between groups variance and within group variance to get more convincing differences between the average group scores in Figure \@ref(fig:anova-Fratio)?

2. What happens to the F test statistic and its p value if differences are more convincing?

We cannot just use the between groups variance as the test statistic. In Section \@ref(within-variance), we have seen that within group variance results in chance differences between sample means. So we cannot expect that between groups variance to be zero in our sample even if the groups have equal means in the population. 

We have to correct for chance differences and this is done by taking the ratio of between groups variance over within groups variance. This ratio gives us the relative size of observed differences between group means over group mean differences that we expect by chance.

Our test statistic, then, is the ratio of two variances: between groups and within group variance. The F distribution approximates the sampling distribution of the ratio of two variances, so we can use this probability distribution to test the significance of the group mean differences we observe in our sample. Remember that we used the F distribution before for testing a ratio of two variances, namely, in Levene's F test for the null hypothesis that two groups have the same population variance (Section \@ref(Levene-2groups)).

Long story short: We test the substantive null hypothesis that all groups have the same population means in an analysis of variance. But behind the scenes, we actually test between groups variance against within group variance. That is why it is called analysis of variance.

### Assumptions for the F test in analysis of variance {#anova-assumpt}

There are two important assumptions that we must make if we use the F distribution in analysis of variance: (1) Independent samples and (2) homogeneous population variances.

#### Independent samples
The first assumption is that the groups can be regarded as independent samples. As in an independent-samples t test, it must be possible _in principle_ to draw a separate sample for each group in the analysis. Because this is a matter of principle instead of how we actually draw the sample, we have to argue that the assumption is reasonable. We cannot check the assumption against the data.

This is an example of an argument that we can make. In an experiment, we usually draw one sample of subjects but we assign subjects randomly to one of the experimental conditions. This could have easily been done separately for each experimental group. For example, we first draw a subject for the first condition: seeing George Clooney endorsing the fundraising campaign. Next, we draw a subject for the second condition, e.g., Angelina Jolie. The two draws are independent: whomever we have drawn for the Clooney condition is irrelevant to whom we draw for the Jolie condition. Therefore, draws can be independent and the samples can be regarded as independent.

Situation where samples cannot be regarded as independent are the same as in the case of t tests (see Section \@ref(dependentsamples)). For example, samples of first and second observations in a repeated measurement design should not be regarded as independent samples.The analysis of variance models that we use cannot handle repeated measurements. There are models, however, that can handle this type of data.

#### Homogeneous population variances
The F test in analysis of variance assumes that the groups are drawn from the same population. This implies that they have the same average score on the outcome variable in the population as well as the same variance of outcome scores. The null hypothesis tests the equality of population means but we must assume that the groups have equal outcome variable variances in the population.

We can use a statistical test to decide whether or not the population variances are equal (homogeneous). This is the same Levene's F test that we have used in combination with independent samples t tests (Section \@ref(comp-means)). The test's null hypothesis is that the population variances of the groups are equal. If we do _not_ reject the null hypothesis, we decide that the assumption of equal population variances is plausible.

The assumption of equal population variances is less important if group samples are more or less of equal size (see Section \@ref(balanced)). We use a rule of thumb that groups are of equal size if the size of the largest group is less than 10% larger than the size of the smallest group. If this is the case, we do not care about the assumption of homogeneous population variances.

### Which groups have different average scores?

```{r anova-posthoc, fig.cap="Which groups have different average outcome scores in the population?"}
# Goal: Sensitize students to the need for and problems with post-hoc tests.
# Generate and display a sample as in the app anova-F also with option to change group means. Instead of displaying between-groups variance, display the model F test and the results of three t-tests (without Bonferroni correction) for pairwise comparisons.
```

1. Does the F test in analysis of variance tell us which groups have significantly different average population outcome scores? In other words, can we have the same F test result with different sets of group means? Adjust group means in Figure \@ref(fig:anova-posthoc) to demonstrate your answer.

2. Is it possible that the F test is statistically significant but none of the t tests that compare groups one by one? Check your answer with Figure \@ref(fig:anova-posthoc). 

3. Is it Okay that we apply both an F test and several t tests to the same group differences?

If the F test is statistically significant, we reject the null hypothesis that all groups have the same population mean on the outcome variable. In our current example, we reject the null hypothesis that average willingness to donate is equal for people who saw George Clooney, Angelina Jolie, or no endorser for the fund raiser. In other words, we _reject_ the null hypothesis that the endorser does _not_ matter to willingness to donate.

#### Pairwise comparisons as post-hoc tests
With a statistically significant F test, several questions remain to be answered. Does an endorser increase or decrease the willingness to donate? Are both endorsers equally effective? The F test does not provide answers to these questions. We have to compare groups one by one to see which condition (endorser) is associated with a higher level of willingness to donate.

In a pairwise comparison, we have two groups, for example, subjects confronted with George Clooney and subject who did not see a celebrity endorse the fund raiser, that we want to compare on a numeric outcome, namely their willingness to donate. An independent-samples t test is appropriate here. 

With three groups, we can make three pairs: Clooney versus Jolie, Clooney versus nobody, and Jolie versus nobody. We have to execute three t tests on the same data. W already know that there probably are differences in average scores, so the t tests are executed after the fact, in Latin _post hoc_. Hence the name _post hoc tests_.

Applying more than one test to the same data increases the probability of finding at least one statistically significant difference even if there are no differences at all in the population. Section \@ref(cap-chance) discussed this phenomenon as capitalization on chance and it offered a way to correct for this problem, namely Bonferroni correction. 

#### Two steps in analysis of variance
Analysis of variance, then, consists of two steps. In the first step, we test the general null hypothesis that all groups have equal average outcome scores in the population. If we cannot reject this null hypothesis, we have too little evidence to conclude that there are differences between the groups. Our analysis stops here although it is recommended to report the confidence intervals of the group means to inform the reader. Perhaps our sample was just too small to reject the null hypothesis.

If the F test is statistically significant, we proceed to the second step. Here, we apply independent-samples t tests with Bonferroni correction to each pair of groups to see which groups have significantly different means. In our example, we would compare the Clooney and Jolie groups to the group without celebrity endorser to see if celebrity endorsement increases willingness to donate to the fund raiser. In addition, we would compare the Clooney and Jolie groups to see if one celebrity is more effective than the other. 

#### Contradictory results
It may happen that the F test on the model is statistically significant but none of the post hoc tests is statistically significant. This usually happens when the p value of the F test is near .05. Perhaps the correction for capitalization is too strong; this is known to be the case with the Bonferroni correction. Alternatively, the sample is too small for the post hoc test. Note that we have fewer observations in a post hoc test than in the F test because we only look at two of the groups.

This situation illustrates the limitations of null hypothesis significance tests (Chapter \@ref(crit-discus)). Remember that the 5% significance level remains an arbitrary boundary and statistical significance depends a lot on sample size. So do not panic if the F and t tests have contradictory results.

A statistically significant F test tells us that we may be quite confident that at least two group means are different in the population. If none of the post hoc t tests is statistically significant, we should note that it is difficult to pinpoint the differences. Nevertheless, we should report the sample means of the groups (and their standard deviations) as well as their confidence intervals. The two groups that have the most different sample means are most likely to have different population means.

The three groups are more or less of equal sizes:
The largest difference is 4 subjects, which is less
than ten percent of the smallest group (N = 45).
Anyway, we may assume equal population variances,
Levene F (2, 140) = .02, p = .978.

Interpret the results:

Willingness to donate depends on the endorsing celebrity. 
There is a statistically significant difference between average
willingness to donate for the three endorsers, F (2, 140) = 7.44, 
p = .001.
People are more willing to donate if they have seen Clooney 
(M = 4.99, SD = 1.64) or Jolie (M = 4.95, SD = 1.63) endorse the 
fund raiser than people who do not see a celebrity endorser 
(M = 3.87, SD = 1.47). The differences between, on the one 
hand, no celebrity endorser and, on the other hand, Clooney
(p = .002) or Jolie (p = .004) are statistically significant.
However, there is not a substantial or statistically 
significant difference between Clooney and Jolie with 
respect to their effect on willingness to donate (mean difference = 0.04, p = 1.000).

Instead of reporting the F test result in the text, the 
ANOVA table can be included.

2. The data set <a href="http://82.196.4.233:3838/data/smokers.sav" target="_blank">smokers.sav</a> contains (simulated) information on smoking behaviour and attitude towards smoking for a random sample of adults. Does the attitude towards smoking differ among smokers, former smokers, and non-smokers (variable: status3)?

```{r eval=FALSE}

Check data:

There are no impossible scores on the two variables.

Check assumptions:

The Levene test is not staistically significant, 
F (2, 82) = 0.52, p = .595, so we may assume that
smoking attitude for the three groups have equal 
population variances.

Interpret the results:

Average attitude towards smoking scores are not 
significantly different, F (2, 82) = 1.04, p = .358.
Therefore, we have no reason to conclude that one 
group has a more positive attitude towards smoking 
than another group in the population of adults.

## Different Score Levels for Two Factors

```{r anova-twoway, fig.cap="?"}
# Goal: Illustrate that different main effects merely use means of different groupings.
# Similar to app anova-between but with a double classification of cases (according to endorser and sex).
# Generate 6 sets of 2 random observations from a normally distributed population with mean runif(3, 7) and sd = 1. Assign the groups to the experimental treatment factor (endorser, 3 levels) and sex factor (2 levels). Represent observations in a dotplot with treatment as dot colour and sex as dot shape, each observation with a separate value on the x axis, ordered by factor levels. Display grand mean as a horizontal line. Allow user to select (display) group means on one of the two factors. On selection, (old group means vanish and) group means are added as horizontal lines (coloured for the 3 levels factor and different line styles for 2 levels factor) with between group variation indicated by double-sided arcs between group mean and grand mean for each dot (between).

```

1. How does an analysis of variance test the effect of endorser on willingness to donate with the data displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:)? Select the endorser factor in the list box to check your answer.

2. Which effect on willingness to donate is probably stronger: the effect of endorser or of sex? Motivate your answer. Compare a plot with the endorser factor selected to a plot with the sex factor selected.

3. If you want to practice more, draw new samples.

In the preceding section, we have looked at the effect of a single factor, namely, the endorser to whom subjects are exposed, on willingness to donate. Thus, we take into account two variables: one predictor and one outcome variable. This is an example of a bivariate analysis.

Usually, however, we expect an outcome to depend on more than one variable. Willingness to donate does not depend only on the celebrity endorsing a fundraising campaign. It is easy to think of more factors, such as a person's available budget, her personal level of altruism, and so on. 

It is straightforward to include more factors in an analysis of variance. These can be additional experimental treatments in the context of an experiment as well as subject characteristics that are not manipulated by the researcher. For example, we may hypothesize that females are generally more charitable than males.

### Two-way analysis of variance {#anova2way}
If we use one factor, the analysis is called one-way analysis of variance. With two factors, it is called two-way analysis of variance, and with three factors... well, you probably already guessed that name. 

A two-way analysis of variance using a factor with three levels, for example, exposure to three different endorsers, and a second factor with two levels, for example, female versus male, is called a 3x2 (say: three by two) factorial design.

### Balanced design {#balanced}
In analysis of variance with two or more factors, it is quite nice if the factors are statistically independent from one another. In other words, it is nice if the scores on one factor are not associated with scores on another factor. This is called a balanced design. 

In an experiment, we can ensure that factors are independent if we have the same number of subjects in each combination of levels on all factors. In other words, a factorial design is balanced if we have the same number of observations in each subgroup. A subgroup contains the subjects that have the same level in both factors just like a cell in a contingency table. 

```{r anova-balanced, echo=FALSE}
# Table for a balanced 3x2 factorial design.
# Create data.
df <- data.frame(Female = rep(5, 3), Male = rep(5, 3))
row.names(df) <- c("Clooney", "Jolie", "No endorser")
# Display table.
knitr::kable(df, caption = "Number of observations per subgroup in a balanced 3x2 factorial design.")
# Cleanup.
rm(df)
```

Table \@ref(tab:anova-balanced) shows an example of a balanced 3x2 factorial design. Each subgroup (cell) contains five subjects (cases). If you remember the principles of statistical association and independence in contingency tables (Section \@ref(score-combi)), you know that equal distributions of frequencies across columns or across rows indicate statistical independence. In the example, the distributions are the same across columns (and rows), so the factors are statistically independent.

A balanced design is nice but not necessary. Unbalanced designs can be analyzed but estimation is more complicated (a problem for the computer, not for us) and the assumption of equal population variances for all groups is more important (a problem for us, not for the computer). With a balanced design, you are on the safe side.

### Main effects in two-way analysis of variance
A two-way analysis of variance tests the effects of both factors on the outcome variable in one go. It tests the null hypothesis that subjects exposed to Clooney have the same average willingness to donate in the population as subjects exposed to Jolie or those who are not exposed to an endorser. At the same time it tests the null hypothesis that females and males have the same willingness to donate in the population.

The tested effects are _main effects_, that is, an overall or average difference between the mean scores of the groups on the outcome variable. The main effect of the endorser factor shows the mean differences for endorser groups if we do not distinguish between females and males. Likewise, the main effect for sex shows the average difference in willingness to donate between females and males without taking into account the endorser to whom they were exposed.

We could have used two separate one-way analyses of variance to test the same effects. Moreover, we could have tested the difference between females and males with an independent-samples t test. The results would have been the same (if the design is balanced.) But there is an important advantage to using a two-way analysis of variance, to which we turn in the next section.

## Moderation: Score Level Differences that Depend on Context

```{r echo=FALSE}
# TBD: the concept of moderation ; picture (sketch as video) as icon
# for moderation
```

In the preceding section, we have analyzed the effects both of endorser and sex on willingness to donate to a fund raiser. The two main effects isolate the influence of endorser on willingness from the effect of sex and the other way around. These effect assume that endorser and sex have an effect on their own, a general effect.

We should, however, wonder whether endorser always has the same effect. Even if there is a general effect of endorser on willingness to donate, is this effect the same for females and males? Note that one endorser is a male celebrity who is reputed to be quite attractive to women. The other endorser is a female celebrity with a similar reputation among men. In this situation, shouldn't we expect that one endorser is more effective among female subjects and the other among male subjects?

If the effect of a factor is different for different groups on another factor, the first factor's effect is _moderated_ by the second factor. The phenomenon that effects are moderated is called _moderation_. 

With moderation, factors have a combined effect. The context (group score on one factor) affects the effect of the other factor on the outcome variable. The conceptual diagram for moderation expresses the effect of the moderator on the effect of the predictor as an arc pointing at another arc. Figure \@ref(fig:anova-diagram) shows the conceptual diagram for subject's sex moderating the effect of endorsing celebrity on willingness to donate.

```{r anova-diagram, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Conceptual diagram of moderation.", fig.asp=0.3}

### Types of moderation

```{r anova-moderation, fig.cap="How can we recognize main effects and moderation in a means plot?", echo = FALSE, screenshot.opts = list(delay = 5), dev="png", out.width="420px"}
# Goals: Learn to recognize different types of moderation, visually distinguishing between main effects (differences) and moderation (different differences.
# Create a means plot with 3x2 means, willingness on Y axis, endorser (nobody, Clooney, Jolie) on X axis, and different colours for sex. Initial means have main effects but no interaction effect.Connect the means per sex by line segments. Link the female & male mean for the same group by a vertical double-sided arc. Allow user to change all six means (if possible, by dragging them vertically?). Display marginal (total) means for each sex and endorser.
# Initial means.
# d <- data.frame(endorser = factor(c("Nobody","Clooney","Jolie","Nobody","Clooney","Jolie"), levels = c("Nobody","Clooney","Jolie")), sex = as.factor(c(rep("male", 3), rep("female", 3))), willingness_av = c(3, 5, 7, 4.5, 6.5, 8.5))
knitr::include_app("http://82.196.4.233:3838/apps/anova-moderation/", height="560px")
```

1. Does the plot in Figure \@ref(fig:anova-moderation) display a main effect of the factor sex? Motivate your answer.
```{r eval=FALSE}
* A main effect exists if the groups on one predictor
(factor) have unequal means.
* In right-most column of the table, it is easy to see 
that females have a higher average willingness score than
males, so there is a main effect of sex.
* In the plot, the difference is more difficult to see.
You have to guess the average score of females over all
endorsers (the average of the red line) and the average
score of all males (average of the blue line), to see
that females score higher than males on average.
* In this particular plot, the red line is everywhere
above the blue line, so it is relatively easy to see
that females score on average higher than males. But if
the lines cross, that will be more difficult to see.
```

2. Is there a main effect of endorser? Again, motivate your answer.
```{r eval=FALSE}
* Now we have to look at the average scores for the three
endorsers, which are quite clearly different (bottom row
of the table). So yes, there is a main effect of endorser
on willingness.
* In the plot, we have to guess the average score for an
endorser, which is somewhere in the middle of the green
arc linking the score of females to the score of males.
The average score with Clooney as endorser seems to be
higher than the average score without a celebrity endorser,
and the average score for Angelina Jolie is highest.
These differences indicate a main effect for endorser.
```

3. Does subject's sex moderate the effect of endorser? If so, interpret the difference between the effects. If not, explain why there is no moderation.
```{r eval=FALSE}
* In this example, moderation implies that the differences
between endorsers for females are different from the
differences between endorsers for males. Different
differences!
* The red line visualizes the differences between
endorsers for females. The blue line shows the
differences between endorsers for males. If the two
lines have the same shape, that is, if they are 
parallel, the differences are the same for males and
females and there is NO moderation.
* In the example, the red and blue lines are parallel,
so the effect of endorser on willingness is not moderated
by sex.
* Another way to see this is focusing on the green arcs
in the graph. If these arcs have the same length and
the same direction, the differences between males (arc
origin) and females (arc end) are the same for all endorsers.
This indicates that the effect of sex (difference between
male and female within an endorser) is the same for all
endorsers, so endorser does not moderate the effect of sex. 
This also implies the reverse conclusion that sex does not
moderate the effect of endorser because moderation is
symmetrical. 
```

4. Adjust the means in such a way that the effect of endorser is stronger for males than females.
```{r eval=FALSE}
* An effect is stronger if the group averages vary
more strongly.
* Change the means for the males such that there is
more variation between the three blue triangles (male
average scores per endorser) than among the red dots
(female average scores per endorser).
```

5. Adjust the means in such a way that the effects of Clooney and the effects of Jolie cancel out, so there is an interaction effect of endorser with sex but no main effect of endorser.
```{r eval=FALSE}
* For effects to cancel out, the difference between females
and males in willingness if they are exposed to Clooney should
have opposite signs. If males score higher than females
if they are exposed to Clooney, females should score higher
than men if they are exposed to Jolie.
* If you ensure that the average score for Clooney, Jolie,
and subjects not exposed to a celebrity endorser are the same,
there is no main effect of endorser.
```

Moderation happens a lot in communication science for the simple reason that the effects of messages are stronger for people who are more susceptible to the message. If you know more people who have adopted a new product or a healthy/risky lifestyle, you are more likely to be persuaded by media campaigns to also adopt that product or lifestyle. If you are more impressionable, media messages are more effective.

#### Effect strength moderation
Moderation refers to contexts that strengthen or diminish the effect of, for example, a media campaign. Let us refer to this type of mediation as _effect strength moderation_. In our current example, we would hypothesize that the effect of George Clooney as an endorser is stronger for female subjects than male subjects.

In analysis of variance, effects are differences between average outcome scores. The effect of Clooney on willingness to donate, for example, is the difference between the average willingness score of subjects exposed to Clooney and the average score of subjects who were not exposed to a celebrity endorser. 

Different "Clooney effects" for female and male subjects imply different differences! The difference in average willingness scores between females exposed to Clooney and females who are not exposed to an endorser is different from the difference in average scores for males. We have four subgroups with average willingness scores that we have to compare. We have six subgroups if we also include endorsement by Angelina Jolie. 

```{r anova-effectstrengthmod, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.cap="Moderation as a stronger effect within a particular context. The difference between the average score of males who saw  Clooney and males who did not see a celebrity endorser is represented by the slope of the blue line segment at the left. The same effect for females is expressed by the red line segment at the left. The red line segment at the left is steeper than the blue line segment, so the Clooney effect is stronger among females than males. The red and blue line segments to the right are parallel, so the Jolie effect is the same for females and males."}
# Add means plot with Clooney, Jolie, and Nobody on the x axis, willingness to donate on the y axis, and separate (coloured) lines linking the mean scores for females and males. In the plot, the average for females*Clooney is much higher than males*Clooney but the reverse does not apply to Jolie.
d <- data.frame(endorser = factor(c("Nobody","Clooney","Jolie","Nobody","Clooney","Jolie"), levels = c("Clooney","Nobody","Jolie")), sex = as.factor(c(rep("male", 3), rep("female", 3))), willingness_av = c(3, 5, 5, 4.5, 9, 6.5))
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(d, aes(endorser, willingness_av, colour = sex)) + geom_point() + geom_line(aes(group = sex)) + theme_general() + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(1, 10), breaks = c(1, 5, 10)) + labs(x = "Endorser", y = "Average willingness to donate") + scale_color_manual(values=c(brewercolors[[1]], brewercolors[[5]]))
rm(d)
```

A means plot is a very convenient tool to interpret different differences. Connect the means of the subgroups by lines that belong to the same group on the factor you use as moderator. Each line or trace in the plot represents the effect differences within one moderator group. If a line goes up or down, predictor groups have different means, so the predictor has an effect within that moderator group. A flat (horizontal) lines tells us that there is no effect at all within that moderator group  

The distances between the lines show the difference of the differences. If the lines for females and males are parallel, the difference between endorsers is the same for females and males. Then, the effects are the same and there is _no_ moderation. In contrast, if the lines are not parallel but diverge or converge, the differences are different for females and males and there is moderation.

A special case of effect strength moderation is the situation in which the effect is absent (zero) in one context and present in another context. A trivial example would be the effect of an anti-smoking campaign on smoking frequency. For smokers (one context), smoking frequency may go down and the campaign may have an effect. For non-smokers (another context), smoking frequency cannot go down and the campaign cannot have this effect.

Except for trivial cases such as the effect of anti-smoking campaigns on non-smokers, it does not make sense to distinguish sharply between moderation in which the effect is strengthened and moderation in which the effect is present versus absent. In non-trivial cases, it is very rare that an effect is precisely zero.

#### Effect direction moderation

In the other type of moderation the effect in one group is the opposite of the effect in another group. For example, Clooney is a more effective endorser among females than males whereas Jolie is more effective among males than females. Let us call this _effect direction moderation_. Females strengthen the Clooney effect but males strengthen the Jolie effect. 

```{r anova-effectdirmod, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.cap="Moderation as opposite effects in different contexts. The Clooney effect is positive for female subjects: The red line segment at the left shows that females exposed to Clooney are much more willing to donate than females who did not see a celebrity endorser. In contrast, Clooney as endorser reduces the willingness among males (blue line segment at the left). The Jolie effect is the opposite: positive for males, negative for females. In this special situation the effect for females and males cancel out, so there is no main effect of endorser."}
# Add means plot with Clooney, Jolie, and Nobody on the x axis, willingness to donate on the y axis, and separate (coloured) lines linking the mean scores for females and males. In the plot, the average for females*Clooney is much higher than males*Clooney but the reverse does not apply to Jolie.
d <- data.frame(endorser = factor(c("Nobody","Clooney","Jolie","Nobody","Clooney","Jolie"), levels = c("Clooney","Nobody","Jolie")), sex = as.factor(c(rep("male", 3), rep("female", 3))), willingness_av = c(6, 3, 9, 6, 9, 3))
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(d, aes(endorser, willingness_av, colour = sex)) + geom_point() + geom_line(aes(group = sex)) + theme_general() + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(1, 10), breaks = c(1, 5, 10)) + labs(x = "Endorser", y = "Average willingness to donate") + scale_color_manual(values=c(brewercolors[[1]], brewercolors[[5]]))
rm(d)
```

The effect in one group can compensate for the effect in another group if it is about as strong but of the opposite direction. Imagine that George Clooney convinces females to donate but discourages males to donate because his charms backfires on men (pure jealousy, perhaps.) Similarly, Angelina Jolie may have opposite effects on females and males. 

In this situation, the main effect of endorser on willingness to donate is (nearly) zero. If we average over females and males, there is no net difference between Clooney, Jolie, and the condition without an endorser. This does not mean that the endorser does not matter. On the contrary, the interaction effects tell us that the endorser is effective for one group but counterproductive for another group. The second part of the conclusion is just as important as the first part. The campaign should avoid to  decrease the willingness to donate among particular target groups.

### Testing main and interaction effects

```{r anova-interaction, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="How can we recognize main effects and moderation in a means plot?", screenshot.opts = list(delay = 5), dev="png", out.width="420px"}
# Goals: Recognize effect size and statistical significance of main and interaction effects.
# Exactly the same app as anova-moderation but now add Eta^2 and the F value plus p value of the main and interaction effects.
# Initial means.
# d <- data.frame(endorser = factor(c("Nobody","Clooney","Jolie","Nobody","Clooney","Jolie"), levels = c("Nobody","Clooney","Jolie")), sex = as.factor(c(rep("male", 3), rep("female", 3))), willingness_av = c(3, 5, 7, 4.5, 6.5, 8.5))
knitr::include_app("http://82.196.4.233:3838/apps/anova-interaction/", height="630px")
```

1. Adjust the means in Figure \@ref(fig:anova-interaction) in such a way that the mean effect of endorser and the interaction effect of endorser and sex are statistically significant.
```{r eval=FALSE}
* If the app loads, there is a main effect of endorser.
The effect size expressed by eta2 is clearly larger than
zero and the F test on the endorser main effect is highly
significant (p < .001).
* The main effect indicates that the
endorser group means (bottom row of the table) are
(clearly) different. We should maintain these differences
if we want to maintain the main effect.
* The interaction effect is initially zero and not
statistically significant. This means that the differences
between females and males (expressed by the green arcs)
do not vary (sufficiently) between the endorsers. In the
initial situation, the difference between females and
males is exactly the same for all endorsers, namely 1.5.
* Change the difference between males and females within
one or more endorser categories to create a sizable and
statistically significant interaction effect. 
* But ensure that the total differences between the
endorser remain. For example, increase the female scores
for one endorser and lower the male scores for that endorser
such that the average for the endorser remains the
same.
```

2. Adjust the means in such a way that the mean effect of endorser is _not_ statistically significant but the interaction effect of endorser and sex is statistically significant.
```{r eval=FALSE}
* To obtain a non-significant main effect of endorser,
the mean scores for the endorsers (bottom row of the table)
must be more or less the same. So lower the scores for
females and males for endorsers with high average scores and
increase the scores for endorsers with low scores until
the means in the bottom row are equal.
* If you want to have an interaction effect, you must ensure
that the difference between females and males is clearly
different for different endorsers. For example, increase
the male scores for one endorser and decrease the female
scores with the same amount.
```

3. Is it possible to have a statistically significant interaction effect but no statistically significant main effects? If so, adjust the scores in Figure \@ref(fig:anova-interaction) to prove your case.
```{r eval=FALSE}
* Yes, it is possible to have a statistically significant
interaction effect but no statistically significant main
effects. 
* Adjust the scores in the table such that both the row
totals (average per endorser) and the column totals
(average per sex) are equal. To get the same averages for
males and females (rows) while preserving equal averages for
endorsers, you must increase or decrease the female (or
male) scores equally for all endorsers (columns).
* Of course, if you start with a table with equal
average scores for all subgroup, you have a situation
with no main effects.
* You can obtain an interaction effect in this
situation by changing the average scores for females and
males for one endorser, such that the endorser average score
remains the same and applying the opposite change to females
and males for another endorser.
* You will see that red and blue lines cross.
```

For main effects we compare average scores among groups within one factor. A two-way analysis of variance includes two main effects, one for each factor (see Section \@ref(anova2way)). Females are on average more willing to donate than males in Figure \@ref(fig:anova-effectstrengthmod). 

For moderation, however, we compare average scores of subgroups, that is, groups that combine a level on one factor and a level on another factor. In Figure \@ref(fig:anova-effectstrengthmod), for example, we compare average willingness to donate for combinations of endorser and subject's sex. Interpretation of moderation requires some training because we must abstract from main effects. The fact that females score on average higher than males is irrelevant to moderation but it does affect all subgroup mean scores. 

Moderation concerns the differences between subgroups that remain if we remove the overall differences between groups, that is, the differences that are captured by the main effects. The remaining differences between subgroup average scores provide us with a between groups variance. In addition, the variation of outcome scores within subgroups yield a within groups variance. 

We can use the between groups and within group variances to execute an F test just like we do with main effects. The effect of subgroups on the outcome variable is called _interaction effect_. The null hypothesis of an F test on an interaction effect states that the subgroups have the same population averages if we correct for the main effects. In other words, the null hypothesis is that there is no moderation. 

Note that we must include the main effects in the model if we want to correct for them in our test of an interaction effect. If we would exclude main effects, we assume that there are no main effects. Why assume that if we can test for the the presence or absence of main effects?

Moderation between three or more factors is possible. These are called _higher-order interactions_. It is wise to include both main effects and lower-order interactions if we test a higher-order interaction. As a result, our model becomes very complicated and hard to interpret. If (first-order) interaction between two predictors must be interpreted as different differences, interaction between three factors must be interpreted as different differences in differences. That's difficult to imagine, so let us not use them in this course.

### Assumptions for two-way analysis of variance
The assumptions for a two-way analysis of variance are the same as for a one-way analysis of variance (Section \@ref(anova-assumpt)). Just note that equal group sizes now apply to the subgroups formed by the combination of the two factors.

## Reporting Two-Way Analysis of Variance

The main purpose of reporting a two-way analysis of variance, is to show the reader the differences between average outcome scores between groups on the same factor (main effects) and different differences for groups on a second factors (interaction effect). A means plot is very suitable for this purpose. Conventionally, we place the predictor groups on the horizontal axis and we draw different lines for the moderator groups. But you can switch them if it produces a more appealing graph.

```{r 2way-meansplot, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.cap="An example of a means plot."}
# {TBD}
# Basic colors and layout.
source("../apps/plottheme/styling.R")
# Create effect sizes.
donors <- haven::read_spss("data/donors.sav")
donors$sex <- factor(donors$sex, labels = names(attributes(donors$sex)$labels))
donors$endorser <- factor(donors$endorser, labels = names(attributes(donors$endorser)$labels))
library(dplyr)
d <- donors %>% group_by(sex, endorser) %>%
  summarise(mean_willing = mean(willing_post))
library(ggplot2)

For the statistically informed reader, you should include the following information somewhere in your report:

* That you used analysis of variance and the type (one-way or two-way).

* The test result for every effect, consisting of the test name (_F_), the degrees of freedom, and the significance (p value). APA6 proscribes the following format if you report the test result within your text: F (df1, df1) = F value, p = p value. 

* For each effect worth interpretation, because it is sizable and/or statistically significant, report eta-squared (eta^2^ or  eta^2^) and interpret it in terms of effect size. If you have to calculate eta-squared by hand, divide the between-groups sum of squares of an effect by the total sum of squares (SPSS: corrected total).

* For each effect worth interpretation, clarify which group or subgroup scores higher. Report the group means and their standard deviations or the mean difference (from the post-hoc tests) for comaprisons between groups as well as their p values here.

* As always, don't forget to mention the units (cases) and the meaning of the variables (factors and outcome). They describe the topic of the analysis.

* Report it if the main assumption is violated, that is, if you have (sub)groups of unequal size and the test on homogeneous variances is statistically significant. In this situation, report the test result of the latter test just like you report the F test of a main effect (see above).

In a two-way analysis of analysis, the number of numeric results can be large. It is recommended to present them as a table (in the text or in an appendix). If you report the table, include the error, the sums of squares and mean squares in the way, for example, SPSS reports them. Table \@ref(tab:2way-table) presents an example.

```{r 2way-table, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
results <- anova(lm(willing_post ~ sex*endorser, data = donors))
results <- cbind(round(results[,2], digits = 2), round(results[,1], digits = 0), round(results[,3:4], digits = 2), round(results[,5], digits = 3))
row.names(results)[3] <- "endorser*sex"
row.names(results)[4] <- "Error"
results[5,] <- c(round(sum(results[,2]), digits = 2), sum(results[,3]), NA, NA, NA)
row.names(results)[5] <- "Total"
results$`round(results[, 5], digits = 3)`[results$`round(results[, 5], digits = 3)` < 0.001] <- "< 0.001"
options(knitr.kable.NA = '')
knitr::kable(results, caption = "An example of a table summarizing results of a two-way analysis of variance.", col.names = c("Sum of Squares", "df", "Mean Square", "F", "p"), align = rep("r", 5)) 
# Cleanup.

### Exercises

1. Use the data in <a href="http://82.196.4.233:3838/data/donors.sav" target="_blank">donors.sav</a> to test if the effect of celebrity endorsement on adults' willingness to donate differs for females and males. Check the assumptions and interpret the results. Create a plot to communicate your results.

```{r eval=FALSE}
SPSS syntax:

* Check data.
FREQUENCIES VARIABLES=willing_post endorser sex
  /ORDER=ANALYSIS.
* Two-way analysis of variance.
UNIANOVA willing_post BY endorser sex
  /METHOD=SSTYPE(3)
  /INTERCEPT=INCLUDE
  /POSTHOC=endorser(BONFERRONI) 
  /PLOT=PROFILE(endorser*sex)
  /PRINT=HOMOGENEITY DESCRIPTIVE
  /CRITERIA=ALPHA(.05)
  /DESIGN=endorser sex endorser*sex.

Check data:

There are no impossible values on the three variables.

Check assumptions:

All six subggroups are of nearly equal size and/or
the Levene test on homogeneity of variances is not 
statistically significant, F (5, 137) = 0.43, p = .825,
so the most important assumptions are met.

Interpret the results:

The question is about moderation, so let us focus our
interpretation on the interaction effect.

Our two-way analysis of variance shows a statistically
significant interaction effect of endorser and sex of
the subject, F (2, 137) = 4.63, p = .011. We may
conclude that the effect of the endorsing celebrity on
an adult''s willingness to donate is different for 
females and males.
Females who saw George Clooney are more strongly willing 
to donate (M = 5.84, SD = 1.48) than males (M = 4.09, 
SD = 1.30). In contrast, there is hardly any difference 
in willingness to donate between males (M = 4.99, 
SD = 1.77) and females (M = 4.91, SD = 1.51) who see 
Angelina Jolie endorse the fund raiser. 
This result suggests that females are more sensitive
to George Clooney as endorser than males but the opposite 
does not apply to Angelina Jolie as endorser.
```

2. Use the same data as in Exercise 1 to test if the effect of celebrity endorsement on willingness to donate depends on remembrance of the campaign. Check the assumptions and interpret the results. Again, create a plot to communicate your results.

```{r eval=FALSE}
SPSS syntax:

* Check data.
FREQUENCIES VARIABLES=willing_post endorser remember
  /ORDER=ANALYSIS.
* Two-way analysis of variance.
UNIANOVA willing_post BY endorser remember
  /METHOD=SSTYPE(3)
  /INTERCEPT=INCLUDE
  /POSTHOC=endorser(BONFERRONI) 
  /PLOT=PROFILE(endorser*remember)
  /PRINT=HOMOGENEITY DESCRIPTIVE
  /CRITERIA=ALPHA(.05)
  /DESIGN=endorser remember endorser*remember.

Check data:

There are no impossible values on the three variables.

Check assumptions:

The six subggroups are not nearly of equal size but
the Levene test on homogeneity of variances is not 
statistically significant, F (5, 137) = 0.06, p = .997,
so the most important assumptions are met.

Interpret the results:

For adults who do not remember the campaign, the effect 
of seeing Angelina Jolie endorse the fund raiser seems 
to be relatively low in comparison to the effect for 
adults who do remember the campaign. This can be seen in 
the means plot.
However, a two-way analysis of variance tells us that the 
interaction effect of endorser with campaign remembrance 
on willingness to donate is very weak and not statistically 
significant, F (2, 137) = 0.67, p = .514, eta2 = .01. 
Both the endorsing celebrity and campaign remembrance 
seem to have statistically significant effects on
willingness to donate, but the effect of celebrity 
endorser on willingness to donate is not clearly
different for adults who remember the campaign and
those who do not remember the campaign.

Note that eta2 was calculated by hand, dividing the
sum of squares of the interaction effect by the sum
of squares of the corrected total.
```

3. Data set <a href="http://82.196.4.233:3838/data/smokers.sav" target="_blank">smokers.sav</a> contains information about smoking on a random sample of adults. Does the attitude towards smoking depend on the adult's smoking behaviour (smoker, former smoker, or non-smoker) and on exposure to an anti-smoking campaign? 
  Recode exposure scores into three groups: low exposure (scores 3 or less), medium exposure (scores 3 to 7), and high exposure (scores above 7).

```{r eval=FALSE}
SPSS syntax:

* Check data.
FREQUENCIES VARIABLES=status3 exposure attitude
  /ORDER=ANALYSIS.
* Group exposure to anti-smoking campaign.
RECODE exposure (Lowest thru 3=1) (3 thru 7 = 2) (ELSE=3) INTO exposure3.
VARIABLE LABELS  exposure3 'Exposure to anti-smoking campaign'.
EXECUTE.
* Define Variable Properties.
*exposure3.
VALUE LABELS exposure3
  1.00 'Low exposure'
  2.00 'Medium exposure'
  3.00 'High exposure'.
EXECUTE.
* Two-way analysis of variance.
UNIANOVA attitude BY status3 exposure3
  /METHOD=SSTYPE(3)
  /INTERCEPT=INCLUDE
  /POSTHOC=status3 exposure3(BONFERRONI) 
  /PLOT=PROFILE(status3*exposure3)
  /PRINT=HOMOGENEITY DESCRIPTIVE
  /CRITERIA=ALPHA(.05)
  /DESIGN=status3 exposure3 status3*exposure3.

Check data:

All values on the variables seem to be valid.

Check assumptions:

The six subgroups (defined by combinations of smoking
status and exposure) are definitely not of equal size.
The test on homogeneity of variances is statistically 
significant, F (8, 76) = 2.17, p = .039.
We are quite confident that the variance of smoking 
attitude in the population is unequal for all subgroups.
We do not meet the assumptions, so we should report
this as a disclaimer.

Interpret the results:

Because we are going to interpret all effects, it is
recommended to present the table with between-subjects
effects instead of reporting all F test results in the 
text.
  
Exposure clearly matters to smoking attitude according 
to our two-way analysis of variance. High exposure is 
associated with a more negative attitude towards smoking 
(M = -0.52, SD = 1.26) than medium exposure (M = 0.18, 
SD = 1.95, difference: p = .024), which is more negative 
than the attitude for adults with low exposure (M = 0.99, 
SD = 1.34, difference: p = .006). Exposure accounts for
21 percent of the variation in attitude towards smoking.

Smoking status also matters to attitude towards smoking. 
Former smokers (M = -1.70, SD = 1.71) are significantly 
more negative towards smoking then smokers (M = 0.80, 
SD = 1.67, difference: p < .001) and non-smokers 
(M = 0.64, SD = 1.17, difference: p < .001). 
The difference between the latter two groups is not 
statistically significant (p = 1.000). Smoking status 
accounts for 25 percent of the differences in smoking 
attitude.

There is a weak (eta2 = 0.13) and statistically significant 
interaction effect of smoking status with exposure on
attitude towards smoking. If we inspect the means plot, 
we see that the effect of exposure on attitude is moderated by smoking status. Former smokers with low exposure are much
more positive (less negative) about smoking than we would
expect. Or, in other words, medium and high exposure to
the campaign decreases their attitude more than the 
attitudes of smokers or non-smokers.

Note that the proportions of explained variance (eta2)
have been calculated manually.

## Take-Home Points  

* In an analysis of variance, we test the substantive null hypothesis that all groups have the same population means. Behind the scenes, we actually test the ratio of between groups variance to within group variance.

* The overall differences in average outcome scores between groups one one factor (predictor) are a main effect in an analysis of variance.

* The differences in average outcome scores between subgroups, that is, groups that combine a level on one factor and a level on another factor, represent an interaction effect. Note that we are dealing with the differences between subgroup scores that remain after the main effects have been removed.

* Moderation is the phenomenon that an effect is different in different contexts. The effect can be stronger or it can have a different direction. In analysis of variance, interaction effects represent moderation.

* Eta^2^ measures the size of both main and interaction effects in analysis of variance. It tells us the proportion of variance in the outcome variable that is accounted for by the effect.

* A means plot is very helpful for interpreting and communicating results of analysis of variance.

* The F tests in analysis of variance do not tell us which groups have different average outcome scores. To this end, we use independent-samples t tests as post hoc tests with a (Bonferroni) correction for capitalization on chance.

* To apply analysis of variance, we need a numeric outcome variable that has equal population variance in each group of a factor or each subgroup in case of an interaction effect. However, equality of population variances is not important if all groups on a factor or all subgroups in an interaction are more or less of equal size (the largest count is at most 10% larger than the smallest count.)
