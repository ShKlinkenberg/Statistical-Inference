It discusses a minimal set of concepts needed to understand both the possibilities and pitfalls of estimation, null hypothesis testing, moderation, and mediation analysis. It uses a minimum of formal notation. Intended Audience and Setting This book is written as reading material for a follow-up course in statistics, in the bachelor of Communication Science at the University of Amsterdam. Students enrolled in this course have passed an introductory course in statistics that explained how to change research questions into variables and associations between variables, how to select and execute the correct analysis or test (in SPSS) to answer their research question, and how to interpret the results in a language that is both comprehensible for the average reader and complying with professional standards (APA standard for reporting test results). In addition, they have learned the very basics of inferential statistics: How to decide which null hypothesis to reject based on reported p values, and how to interpret confidence intervals. This book is meant for use in a flipped-classroom setting. Students should read the text, watch embedded videos, and play with the interactive content before they meet in class. Class meetings are used to answer questions raised by the students, do group work to exercise with the concepts and techniques presented in the text, and do short tests to check understanding. Interactive Content The interactive content in this book replaces simulations that used to be demonstrated during lectures. I expect that doing simulations yourself rather than watching them being done by someone else enhances understanding. I have tried to break down the simulations into smaller steps, confronting the student several times with essentially the same simulation, but with added complexity. I hope that this approach enhances understanding and remembrance and, at the same time, avoids frustration caused by complex dashboards offering all options at once. Disclaimer The example data sets have been generated for the purpose of demonstrating statistical techniques. These are not real data and no conclusions should be drawn from the results obtained from the data.

Key concepts: inferential statistics, generalization, population, random sample, sample statistic, sampling space, random variable, sampling distribution, probability, probability distribution, discrete probability distribution, expected value/expectation, unbiased estimator, parameter, (downward) biased, representative sample, continuous variable, continuous probability distribution, probability density, (left-hand/right-hand) probability. Watch this micro lecture on sampling distributions for an overview of the chapter. Summary What does our sample tell us about the population from which it was drawn? Statistical inference is about estimation and null hypothesis testing. We have collected data on a random sample and we want to draw conclusions (make inferences) about the population from which the sample was drawn. From the proportion of yellow candies in our sample bag, for instance, we want to estimate a plausible range of values for the proportion of yellow candies in a factory’s stock (confidence interval). Alternatively, we may want to test the null hypothesis that one fifth of the candies in a factory’s stock is yellow. The sample does not offer a perfect miniature image of the population. If we would draw another random sample, it would have different characteristics. For instance, it would contain more or fewer yellow candies than the previous sample. To make an informed decision on the confidence interval or null hypothesis, we must compare the characteristic of the sample that we have drawn to the characteristics of the samples that we could have drawn. The characteristics of the samples that we could have drawn constitute a sampling distribution. Sampling distributions are the central element in estimation and null hypothesis testing. In this chapter, we simulate sampling distributions to understand what they are. Here, simulation means that we let a computer draw many random samples from a population. In Communication Science, we usually work with samples of human beings, for instance, users of social media, people looking for health information or entertainment, citizens preparing to cast a political vote, an organization’s stakeholders, or samples of media content such as tweets, tv advertisements, or newspaper articles. In the current and two subsequent chapters, however, we avoid the complexities of these samples. We focus on a very tangible kind of sample, namely a bag of candies, which helps us understand the basic concepts of statistical inference: sampling distributions (the current chapter), probability distributions (Chapter 2), and estimation (Chapter 3). Once we thoroughly understand these concepts, we turn to Communication Science examples. "],["1.1-statistical-inference-making-the-most-of-your-data.html", "1.1 Statistical Inference: Making the Most of Your Data", " 1.1 Statistical Inference: Making the Most of Your Data Statistics is a tool for scientific research. It offers a range of techniques to check whether statements about the observable world are supported by data collected from that world. Scientific theories strive for general statements, that is, statements that apply to many situations. Checking these statements requires lots of data covering all situations addressed by theory. Collecting data, however, is expensive, so we would like to collect as little data as possible and still be able to draw conclusions about a much larger set. The cost and time involved in collecting large sets of data are also relevant to applied research, such as market research. In this context we also like to collect as little data as necessary. Inferential statistics offers techniques for making statements about a larger set of observations from data collected for a smaller set of observations. The large set of observations about which we want to make a statement is called the population. The smaller set is called a sample. We want to generalize a statement about the sample to a statement about the population from which the sample was drawn. Traditionally, statistical inference is generalization from the data collected in a random sample to the population from which the sample was drawn. This approach is the focus of the present book because it is currently the most widely used type of statistical inference in the social sciences. We will, however, point out other approaches in Chapter 6. Statistical inference is conceptually complicated and for that reason quite often used incorrectly. We will therefore spend quite some time on the principles of statistical inference. Good understanding of the principles should help you to recognize and avoid incorrect use of statistical inference. In addition, it should help you to understand the controversies surrounding statistical inference and developments in the practice of applying statistical inference that are taking place. Investing time and energy in fully understanding the principles of statistical inference really pays off later. "],["1.2-discreterandomvariable.html", "1.2 A Discrete Random Variable: How Many Yellow Candies in My Bag?", " 1.2 A Discrete Random Variable: How Many Yellow Candies in My Bag? An obvious but key insight in statistical inference is this: If we draw random samples from the same population, we are likely to obtain different samples. No two random samples from the same population need to be identical, even though they can be identical. 1.2.1 Sample statistic We are usually interested in a particular characteristic of the sample rather than in the exact nature of each observation within the sample. For instance, I happen to be very fond of yellow candies. If I buy a bag of candies, my first impulse is to tear the bag open and count the number of yellow candies. Am I lucky today? Does my bag contain a lot of yellow candies? Figure 1.1: How many yellow candies will our sample bag contain? The number of yellow candies in a bag is an example of a sample statistic: a value describing a characteristic of the sample. Each bag, that is, each sample, has one outcome score on the sample statistic. For instance, one bag contains four yellow candies, another bag contains seven, and so on. All possible outcome scores constitute the sampling space. A bag of ten candies may contain 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 yellow candies. The numbers 0 to 10 are the sampling space of the sample statistic number of yellow candies in a bag. The sample statistic is called a random variable. It is a variable because different samples can have different scores. The value of a variable may vary from sample to sample. It is a random variable because the score depends on chance, namely the chance that a particular sample is drawn. 1.2.2 Sampling distribution Some sample statistic outcomes occur more often than other outcomes. We can see this if we draw very many random samples from a population and collect the frequencies of all outcome scores in a table or chart. We call the distribution of the outcome scores of very many samples a sampling distribution. Figure 1.2: What is a sampling distribution? 1.2.3 Probability and probability distribution What is the probability of buying a bag with exactly five yellow candies? In statistical terminology, what is the probability of drawing a sample with five yellow candies as sample statistic outcome? This probability is the proportion of all possible samples that we could have drawn that happen to contain five yellow candies. Of course, the probability of a sample bag with exactly five yellow candies depends on the share of yellow candies in the population of all candies. Figure 1.3 displays the probabilities of a sample bag with a particular number of yellow candies if twenty per cent of the candies in the population are yellow. You can adjust the population share of yellow candies to see what happens. Figure 1.3: How does the probability of drawing a sample bag with two out of ten candies yellow depend on the proportion of yellow candies in the population? The sampling distribution tells us all possible samples that we could have drawn. We can use the distribution of all samples to get the probability of buying a bag with exactly five yellow candies from the sampling distribution: We divide the number of samples with five yellow candies by the total number of samples we have drawn. For example, if 26 out of all 1000 samples have five yellow candies, the proportion of samples with five yellow candies is 26 / 1000 = 0.026. Then, the probability of drawing a sample with five yellow candies is 0.026 (we usually write: .026). If we change the frequencies in the sampling distribution into proportions, we obtain the probability distribution of the sample statistic: A sampling space with a probability (between 0 and 1) for each outcome of the sample statistic. Because we are usually interested in probabilities, sampling distributions tend to have proportions, that is probabilities, instead of frequencies on the vertical axis. See Figure 1.4 for an example. Figure 1.3 displays the probability distribution of the number of yellow candies per bag of ten candies. This is an example of a discrete probability distribution because only a limited number of outcomes are possible. It is feasible to list the probability of each outcome separately. The sampling distribution as a probability distribution conveys very important information. It tells us which outcomes we can expect, in our example, how many yellow candies we may find in our bag of ten candies. Moreover, it tells us the probability that a particular outcome may occur. If the sample is drawn from a population in which 20% of candies are yellow, we are quite likely to find zero, one, two, three, or four yellow candies in our bag. A bag with five yellow candies would be rare, six or seven candies would be very rare, and a bag with more than seven yellow candies is extremely unlikely but not impossible. If we buy such a bag, we know that we have been extremely lucky. We may refer to probabilities both as a proportion, that is, a number between 0 and 1, and as a percentage: a number between 0% and 100%. Proportions are commonly considered to be the correct way to express probabilities. When we talk about probabilities, however, we tend to use percentages; we may, for example, say that the probabilities are fifty-fifty. 1.2.4 Expected value or expectation We haven’t yet thought about the value that we are most likely to encounter in the sample that we are going to draw. Intuitively, it must be related to the distribution of colours in the population of candies from which the sample was drawn. In other words, the share of yellow candies in the factory’s stock from which the bag was filled or in the machine that produces the candies, seems to be relevant to what we may expect to find in our sample. Figure 1.4: What is the expected value of a probability distribution? If the share of yellow candies in the population is 0.20 (or 20%), we expect one out of each five candies in a bag (sample) to be yellow. In a bag with 10 candies, we would expect two candies to be yellow: one out of each five candies or the population proportion times the total number of candies in the sample = 0.20 * 10 = 2.0. This is the expected value. The expected value of the proportion of yellow candies in the sample is equal to the proportion of yellow candies in the population. If you carefully inspect a sampling distribution (Figure 1.4), you will see that the expected value also equals the mean of the sampling distribution. This makes sense: Excess yellow candies in some bags must be compensated for by a shortage in other bags. Thus we arrive at the definition of the expected value of a random variable: The expected value is the average of the sampling distribution of a random variable. In our example, the random variable is a sample statistic, more specifically, the number of yellow candies in a sample. The sampling distribution is an example of a probability distribution, so, more generally, the expected value is the average of a probability distribution. The expected value is also called the expectation of a probability distribution. 1.2.5 Unbiased estimator Note that the expected value of the proportion of yellow candies in the bag (sample statistic) equals the true proportion of yellow candies in the candy factory (population statistic). For this reason, the sample proportion is an unbiased estimator of the proportion in the population. More generally, a sample statistic is called an unbiased estimator of the population statistic if the expected value (mean of the sampling distribution) is equal to the population statistic. By the way, we usually refer to the population statistic as a parameter. Most but not all sample statistics are unbiased estimators of the population statistic. Think, for instance, of the actual number of yellow candies in the sample. This is certainly not an unbiased estimator of the number of yellow candies in the population. Because the population is so much larger than the sample, the population must contain many more yellow candies than the sample. If we were to estimate the number in the population (the parameter) from the number in the sample—for instance, we estimate that there are two yellow candies in the population of all candies because we have two in our sample of ten—we are going to vastly underestimate the number in the population. This estimate is downward biased: It is too low. In contrast, the proportion in the sample is an unbiased estimator of the population proportion. That is why we do not use the number of yellow candies to generalize from our sample to the population. Instead, we use the proportion of yellow candies. You probably already did this intuitively. Sometimes, we have to adjust the way in which we calculate a sample statistic to get an unbiased estimator. For instance, we must calculate the standard deviation and variance in the sample in a special way to obtain an unbiased estimate of the population standard deviation and variance. The exact calculation need not bother us, because our statistical software takes care of that. Our software only uses unbiased estimators. 1.2.6 Representative sample Because the share of yellow candies in the population represents the probability of drawing a yellow candy, we also expect 20% of the candies in our bag to be yellow. For the same reason we expect the shares of all other colours in our sample bag to be equal to their shares in the population. As a consequence, we expect a random sample to resemble the population from which it is drawn. A sample is representative of a population (in the strict sense) if variables in the sample are distributed in the same way as in the population. Of course, we know that a random sample is likely to differ from the population due to chance, so the actual sample that we have drawn is usually not representative of the population in the strict sense. But we should expect it to be representative, so we say that it is in principle representative or representative in the statistical sense of the population. We can use probability theory to account for the misrepresentation in the actual sample that we draw. This is what we do when we use statistical inference to construct confidence intervals and test null hypotheses, as we will learn in later chapters. "],["1.3-cont-random-var.html", "1.3 A Continuous Random Variable: Overweight And Underweight.", " 1.3 A Continuous Random Variable: Overweight And Underweight. Let us now look at another variable: the weight of candies in a bag. The weight of candies is perhaps more interesting to the average consumer than candy colour because candy weight is related to calories. 1.3.1 Continuous variable Weight is a continuous variable because we can always think of a new weight between two other weights. For instance, consider two candy weights: 2.8 and 2.81 grams. It is easy to see that there can be a weight in between these two values, for instance, 2.803 grams. Between 2.8 and 2.803 we can discern an intermediate value such as 2.802. In principle, we could continue doing this endlessly, e.g., find a weight between 2.80195661 and 2.80195662 grams even if our scales may not be sufficiently precise to measure any further differences. It is the principle that counts. If we can always think of a new value in between two values, the variable is continuous. Continuous variable: We can always think of a new value in between two values. 1.3.2 Continuous sample statistic We are not interested in the weight of a single candy. If a relatively light candy is compensated for by a relatively heavy candy in the same bag, we still get the calories that we want. We are interested in the average weight of all candies in our sample bag, so average candy weight in our sample bag is our key sample statistic. We want to say something about the probabilities of average candy weight in the samples of candies that we can draw. Can we do that? When we turn to the probabilities of getting samples with a particular average candy weight, we run into problems with a continuous sample statistic. If we would want to know the probability of drawing a sample bag with an average candy weight of 2.8 grams, we should exclude sample bags with an average candy weight of 2.81 grams, or 2.801 grams, or 2.8000000001 grams, and so on. In fact, we are very unlikely to draw a sample bag with an average candy weight of exactly 2.8 grams, that is, with an infinite number of zeros trailing 2.8. In other words, the probability of such a sample bag is for all practical purposes zero and negligible. This applies to every average candy weight, so all probabilities are virtually zero. The probability distribution of the sampling space, that is, of all possible outcomes, is going to be very boring: just (nearly) zeros. And it will take forever to list all possible outcomes within the sampling space, because we have an infinite number of possible outcomes. After all, we can always find a new average candy weight between two selected weights. 1.3.3 Probability density With a continuous sample statistic, we must look at a range of values instead of a single value. We can meaningfully talk about the probability of having a sample bag with an average candy weight of at least 2.8 grams or at most 2.8 grams. We choose a threshold, in this example 2.8 grams, and determine the probability of values above or below this threshold. We can also use two thresholds, for example the probability of an average candy weight between 2.75 and 2.85 grams. This is probably what you were thinking of when I referred to a bag with 2.8 grams as average candy weight. If we cannot determine the probability of a single value, which we used to depict on the vertical axis in a plot of a sampling distribution, and we have to link probabilities to a range of values on the x axis, for example, average candy weight above/below 2.8 grams, how can we display probabilities? We have to display a probability as an area between the horizontal axis and a curve. This curve is called a probability density function, so if there is a label to the vertical axis of a continuous probability distribution, it is “Probability density” instead of “Probability”. Figure 1.5 shows an example of a continuous probability distribution for the average weight of candies in a sample bag. This is the familiar normal distribution so we could say that the normal curve is the probability density function here. The total area under this curve is set to one, so the area belonging to a range of sample outcomes (average candy weight) is 1 or less, as probabilities should be. Figure 1.5: How do we display probabilities in a continuous sampling distribution? Tip: Click on a slider handle and use your keyboard arrow keys to make small changes to the slider handle position. A probability density function can give us the probability of values between two thresholds. It can also give us the probability of values up to (and including) a threshold value, which is known as a left-hand probability, or the probability of values above (and including) a threshold value, which is called a right-hand probability. In a null hypothesis significance test (Chapter 4), right-hand and left-hand probabilities are used to calculate p values. Why did I put (and including) between parentheses? It does not really matter whether we add the exact boundary value (2.8 grams) to the probability on the left or on the right because the probability of getting a bag with average candy weight at exactly 2.8 grams (with a very long trail of zero decimals) is negligible. Are you struggling with the idea of areas instead of heights (values on the vertical axis) as probabilities? Just realize that we could use the area of a bar in a histogram instead of the height as indication of the probability in discrete probability distributions, for example, Figure 1.4. The bars in a histogram are all equally wide, so (relative) differences between bar areas are equal to differences in bar height. 1.3.4 Probabilities always sum to 1 While you were playing with Figure 1.5, you may have noticed that displayed probabilities always add up to one. This is true for every probability distribution because it is part of the definition of a probability distribution. In addition, you may have realized that we can use probability distributions in two ways. We can use them to say how likely or unlikely we are to draw a sample with the sample statistic value in a particular range. For example, what is the chance that we draw a sample bag with average candy weight over 2.9 grams? But we can also use a probability distribution to find the threshold values that separate the top ten per cent or the bottom five per cent in a distribution. If we want a sample bag with highest average candy weight, say, belonging to the ten per cent bags with highest average candy weight, what should be the minimum average candy weight in the sample bag? "],["1.4-concluding-remarks.html", "1.4 Concluding Remarks", " 1.4 Concluding Remarks A communication scientist wants to know whether children are sufficiently aware of the dangers of media use. On a media literacy scale from one to ten, an average score of 5.5 or higher is assumed to be sufficient. If we translate this to the simple candy bag example, we realize that the outcome in our sample does not have to be the true population value, for example twenty per cent. If twenty per cent of all candies in the population are yellow, we could very well draw a sample bag with fewer or more than twenty per cent yellow candies. Average media literacy, then, can exceed 5.5 in our sample of children, even if average media literacy is below 5.5 in the population or the other way around. How we decide on this is discussed in later chapters. 1.4.1 Sample characteristics as observations Perhaps the most confusing aspect of sampling distributions is the fact that samples are our cases (units of analysis) and sample characteristics are our observations. We are accustomed to think of observations as measurements on empirical things such as people or candies. We perceive each person or each candy as a case and we observe a characteristic that may change across cases (a variable), for instance the colour or weight of a candy. In a sampling distribution, however, we observe samples (cases) and measure a sample statistic as the (random) variable. Each sample adds one observation to the sampling distribution and its sample statistic value is the value added to the sampling distribution. 1.4.2 Means at three levels If we are dealing with the proportion of yellow candies in a sample (bag), the sample statistic is a proportion and we want to know the proportion of yellow candies in the population. The sampling distribution collects a large number of sample proportions. The mean of the proportions in the sampling distribution (expected value) equals the proportion of yellow candies in the population, because a sample proportion is an unbiased estimator of the population proportion. Things become a little confusing if we are interested in a sample mean, such as the average weight of candies in a sample bag. Now we have means at three levels: the population, the sampling distribution, and the sample. Figure 1.6: What is the relation between the three distributions? The sampling distribution, here, is a distribution of sample means but the sampling distribution itself also has a mean, which is called the expected value or expectation of the sampling distribution. Don’t let this confuse you. The mean of the sampling distribution is the average of the average weight of candies in every possible sample bag. This mean of means has the same value as our first mean, namely the average weight of the candies in the population because a sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean. Remember this: The population and the sample consist of the same type of observations. In the current example, we are dealing with a sample and a population of candies. In contrast, the sampling distribution is based on a different type of observation, namely samples, for example, sample bags of candies. The sampling distribution is the crucial link between the sample and the population. On the one hand the sampling distribution is connected to the population because the population statistic (parameter), for example, average weight of all candies, is equal to the mean of the sampling distribution. On the other hand, it is linked to the sample because it tells us which sample means we will find with what probabilities. We need the sampling distribution to make statements about the population based on our sample. "],["1.5-take-home-points.html", "1.5 Take-Home Points", " 1.5 Take-Home Points Values of a sample statistic vary across random samples from the same population. But some values are more probable than other values. The sampling distribution of a sample statistic tells us the probability of drawing a sample with a particular value of the sample statistic or a particular minimum and/or maximum value. If a sample statistic is an unbiased estimator of a parameter, the parameter value equals the average of the sampling distribution, which is called the expected value or expectation. For discrete sample statistics, the sampling distribution tells us the probability of individual sample outcomes. For continuous sample statistics, it tells us the probability density, which gives us the probability of drawing a sample with an outcome that is at least or at most a particular value, or an outcome that is between two values.

Watch this micro lecture on probability models for an overview of the chapter. Summary How do we get a sampling distribution without drawing many samples ourselves? In the previous chapter, we drew a large number of samples from a population to obtain the sampling distribution of a sample statistic, for instance, the proportion of yellow candies or average candy weight in the sample. The procedure is quite simple: Draw a sample, calculate the desired sample statistic, add the sample statistic value to the sampling distribution, and repeat this thousands of times. Although this procedure is simple, it is not practical. In a research project, we would have to draw thousands of samples and administer a survey to each sample or collect data on the sample in some other way. This requires too much time and money to be of any practical value. So how do we create a sampling distribution, if we only collect data for a single sample? This chapter presents three ways of doing this: bootstrapping, exact approaches, and theoretical approximations. After studying this chapter, you should know the limitations of the three methods of creating a sampling distribution, when to use which method, and how to check the conditions for using a method. "],["2.1-exact-approaches-to-the-sampling-distribution.html", "2.1 Exact Approaches to the Sampling Distribution", " 2.1 Exact Approaches to the Sampling Distribution A second approach to constructing a sampling distribution has implicitly been demonstrated in the preceding section on bootstrapping (Section 2.5) and the section on probability distributions (Section 1.2.3). In these sections, we calculated the true sampling distribution of the proportion of yellow candies in a sample from the probabilities of the colours. If we know or think we know the proportion of yellow candies in the population, we can exactly calculate the probability that a sample of ten candies includes one, two, three, or ten yellow candies. See the section on discrete random variables for details (Section 1.2). Table 2.1: Number of heads for a toss of three coins. Outcome Combination Probability: Combination Probability: Outcome 0 tail-tail-tail 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8 = .125 1/8 = .125 1 tail-tail-head 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8 = .125 1 head-tail-tail 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8 = .125 1 tail-head-tail 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8 = .125 3/8 = .375 2 head-head-tail 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8 = .125 2 head-tail-head 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8 = .125 2 tail-head-head 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8 = .125 3/8 = .375 3 head-head-head 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8 = .125 1/8 = .125 Total 8 1.000 The calculated probabilities of all possible sample statistic outcomes give us an exact approach to the sampling distribution. Note that I use the word approach instead of approximation here because the obtained sampling distribution is no longer an approximation, that is, more or less similar to the true sampling distribution. No, it is the true sampling distribution itself. 2.1.1 Exact approaches for categorical data An exact approach lists and counts all possible combinations. This can only be done if we work with discrete or categorical variables. For an unlimited number of categories, we cannot list all possible combinations. A proportion is based on frequencies and frequencies are discrete (integer values), so we can use an exact approach to create a sampling distribution for one proportion such as the proportion of yellow candies in the example above. The exact approach uses the binomial probability formula to calculate probabilities. Consult the internet if you want to know this formula; we are not going to use it here. Exact approaches are also available for the association between two categorical (nominal or ordinal) variables in a contingency table: Do some combinations of values for the two variables occur relatively frequently? For example, are yellow candies more often sticky than red candies? If candies are either sticky or not sticky and they have one out of a limited set of colours, we have two categorical variables. We can create an exact probability distribution for the combination of colour and stickiness. The Fisher-exact test is an example of an exact approach to the sampling distribution of the association between two categorical variables. 2.1.2 Computer-intensive The exact approach can be applied to discrete variables because they have a limited number of values. Discrete variables are usually measured at the nominal or ordinal level. If the number of categories becomes large, a lot of computing time can be needed to calculate the probabilities of all possible sample statistic outcomes. Exact approaches are said to be computer-intensive. It is usually wise to set a limit to the time you allow your computer to work on an exact sampling distribution because otherwise the problem may keep your computer occupied for hours or days.

In those days, mathematicians and statisticians discovered that many sampling distributions look a lot like known mathematical functions. For example, the sampling distribution of the sample mean can be quite similar to the well-known bell-shape of the normal distribution or the closely related (Student) t distribution. The mathematical functions are called theoretical probability distributions. Most statistical tests use a theoretical probability distribution as approximation of the sampling distribution. Figure 2.3: Normal curve as theoretical approximation of a sampling distribution. The normal distribution is a mathematical function linking continuous scores, e.g., a sample statistic such as the average weight in the sample, to right-hand and left-hand probabilities, that is, to the probability of finding at least, or at most, this score. Such a function is called a probability density function (Section 1.3). We like to use a theoretical probability distribution as an approximation of the sampling distribution because it is convenient. A computer can calculate probabilities from the mathematical function very quickly. We also like theoretical probability distributions because they usually offer plausible arguments about chance and probabilities. 2.3.1 Reasons for a bell-shaped probability distribution The bell shape of the normal distribution makes sense. Our sample of candies is just as likely to be too heavy, as it is too light, so the sampling distribution of the sample mean should be symmetrical. A normal distribution is symmetrical. In addition, it is more likely that our sample bag has an average weight that is near the true average candy weight in the population than an average weight that is much larger or much smaller than the true average. Bags with on average extremely heavy or extremely light candies may occur, but they are extremely rare (we are very lucky or very unlucky). From these intuitions we would expect a bell shape for the sampling distribution. From this argumentation, we conclude that the normal distribution is a reasonable model for the probability distribution of sample means. Actually, it has been proven that the normal distribution exactly represents the sampling distribution in particular cases, for instance the sampling distribution of the mean of a very large sample. 2.3.2 Conditions for the use of theoretical probability distributions Theoretical probability distributions, then, are plausible models for sampling distributions. They are known or likely to have the same shape as the true sampling distributions under particular circumstances or conditions. If we use a theoretical probability distribution, we must assume that the conditions for its use are met. We have to check the conditions and decide whether they are close enough to the ideal conditions. Close enough is of course a matter of judgement. In practice, rules of thumb have been developed to decide if the theoretical probability distribution can be used. Figure 2.4 shows an example in which the normal distribution is a good approximation for the sampling distribution of a proportion in some situations, but not in all situations. Figure 2.4: How does the shape of the sampling distribution of sample proportions change with sample size and proportion value? Do theoretical probability distributions fit the true sampling distribution? As you may have noticed while playing with Figure 2.4, this is not always the case. In general, theoretical probability distributions fit sampling distributions better if the sample is larger. In addition, the population value may be relevant to the fit of the theoretical probability distribution. The sampling distribution of a sample proportion is more symmetrical, like the normal distribution, if the proportion in the population is closer to .5. This illustrates that we often have several conditions for a theoretical probability distribution to fit the sampling distribution. We should evaluate all of them at the same time. In the example of proportions, a large sample is less important if the true proportion is closer to .5 but it is more important for true proportions that are more distant from .5. The rule of thumb for using the normal distribution as the sampling distribution of a sample proportion combines the two aspects by multiplying them and requiring the resulting product to be larger than five. If the probability of drawing a yellow candy is .2 and our sample size is 30, the product is .2 * 30 = 6, which is larger than five. So we may use the normal distribution as approximation of the sampling distribution. Note that this rule of thumb uses one minus the probability, if the probability is larger than .5. In other words, it uses the smaller of two probabilities: the probability that an observation has the characteristic and the probability that it has not. For example, if we want to test the probability of drawing a candy that is not yellow, the probability is .8 and we use 1 - 0.8 = 0.2, which is then multiplied by the sample size. Apart from the normal distribution, there are several other theoretical probability distributions. We have the binomial distribution for a proportion, the t distribution for one or two sample means, regression coefficients, and correlation coefficients, the F distribution for comparison of variances and comparing means for three or more groups (analysis of variance, ANOVA), and the chi-squared distribution for frequency tables and contingency tables. For most of these theoretical probability distributions, sample size is important. The larger the sample, the better. There are additional conditions that must be satisfied such as the distribution of the variable in the population. The rules of thumb are summarized in Table 2.2. Bootstrapping and exact tests can be used if conditions for theoretical probability distributions have not been met. Special conditions apply to regression analysis (see Chapter 8, Section 8.1.4). Table 2.2: Rules of thumb for using theoretical probability distributions. Distribution Sample statistic Minimum sample size Other requirements Binomial distribution proportion (Standard) normal distribution proportion times test proportion (&lt;= .5) &gt;= 5 (Standard) normal distribution one or two means &gt; 100 OR variable is normally distributed in the population and population standard deviation is known (for each group) t distribution one or two means each group &gt; 30 OR variable is normally distributed in each group’s population t distribution (Pearson) correlation coefficient variables are normally distributed in the population t distribution (Spearman) rank correlation coefficient &gt; 30 t distribution regression coefficient 20+ per independent variable See Chapter 8.

Only if the conditions are met, the theoretical probability distribution resembles the sampling distribution sufficiently for using the former as approximation of the latter. Conditions often include sample size. Table ?? reproduces the size requirements from Table 2.2. If you plan to do a t test, each group should contain more than thirty cases. So if you intend to apply t tests, recruit more than thirty participants for each experimental group or more than thirty respondents for each group in your survey. If you expect non-response, that is, sampled participants or respondents unwilling to participate in your research, you should recruit more participants or respondents to have more than thirty observations in the end. Chi-squared tests require a minimum of five expected frequencies per category in a frequency distribution or cell in a contingency table. Your sample size should be at least the number of categories or cells times five to come even near this requirement. Regression analysis requires at least 20 cases per independent variable in the regression model. The variation of sample size across groups is important in analysis of variance (ANOVA), which uses the F distribution. If the number of cases is more or less the same across all groups, we do not have to worry about the variances of the dependent variable for the groups in the population. To be on the safe side, then, it is recommended to design your sampling strategy in such a way that you end up with more or less equal group sizes if you plan to use analysis of variance. 2.3.3 Checking conditions Rules of thumb about sample size are easy to check once we have collected our sample. By contrast, rules of thumb that concern the scores in the population cannot be easily checked, because we do not have information on the population. If we already know what we want to know about the population, why would we draw a sample and do the research in the first place? We can only use the data in our sample to make an educated guess about the distribution of a variable in the population. For example, if the scores in our sample are clearly normally distributed, it is plausible that the scores in the population are normally distributed. In this situation, we do not know that the population distribution is normal but we assume it is. If the sample distribution is clearly not normally distributed, we had better not assume that the population is normally distributed. In short, we sometimes have to make assumptions when we decide on using a theoretical probability distribution. We could use a histogram of the scores in our sample with a normal distribution curve added to evaluate whether a normal distribution applies. Sometimes, we have statistical tests to draw inferences about the population from a sample that we can use to check the conditions. We discuss these tests in a later chapter. 2.3.4 More complicated sample statistics: differences Up to this point, we have focused on rather simple sample statistics such as the proportion of yellow candies or the average weight of candies in a sample. Table 2.2, however, contains more complicated sample statistics. If we compare two groups, for instance, the average weight of yellow and red candies, the sample statistic for which we want to have a sampling distribution must take into account both the average weight of yellow candies and the average weight of red candies. The sample statistic that we are interested in is the difference between the averages of the two samples. Figure 2.5: How do we obtain a sampling distribution for the mean difference of two independent samples? If we draw a sample from both the red and yellow candies in the population, we may calculate the means for both samples and the difference between the two means. For example, the average weight of red candies in the sample bag is 2.76 grams and the average for yellow candies is 2.82 grams. For this pair of samples, the statistic of interest is 2.76 - 2.82 = -0.06, that is, the difference in average weight. If we repeat this many, many times and collect all differences between means in a distribution, we obtain the sampling distribution that we need. The sampling distribution of the difference between two means is similar to a t-distribution, so we may use the latter to approximate the former. Of course, the conditions for using the t-distribution must be met. It is important to note that we do not create separate sampling distributions for the average weight of yellow candies and for the average weight of red candies and then look at the difference between the two sampling distributions. Instead, we create one sampling distribution for the statistic of interest, namely the difference between means. We cannot combine different sampling distributions into a new sampling distribution. We will see the importance of this when we discuss mediation (Chapter 11). 2.3.5 Independent samples If we compare two means, there are two fundamentally different situations that are sometimes difficult to distinguish. When comparing the average weight of yellow candies to the average weight of red candies, we are comparing two samples that are statistically independent (see Figure 2.5), which means that we could have drawn the samples separately. In principle, we could distinguish between a population of yellow candies and a population of red candies, and sample yellow candies from the first population and separately sample red candies from the other population. Whether we sampled the colours separately or not does not matter. The fact that we could have done so implies that the sample of red candies is not affected by the sample of yellow candies or the other way around. The samples are statistically independent. This is important for the way in which probabilities are calculated. Just think of the simple example of flipping two coins. The probability of having heads twice in a row is .5 times .5, that is .25, if the coins are fair and the result of the second coin does not depend on the result of the first coin. The second flip is not affected by the first flip. Imagine that a magnetic field is activated if the first coin lands with heads up and that this magnetic field increases the odds that the second coin will also be heads. Now, the second toss is not independent of the first toss and the probability of getting heads twice is larger than .25. 2.3.6 Dependent samples The example of a manipulated second toss is applicable to repeated measurements. If we want to know how quickly the yellow colour fades when yellow candies are exposed to sun light, we may draw a sample of yellow candies once and measure the colourfulness of each candy at least twice: at the start and end of some time interval. We compare the colourfulness of a candy at the second measurement to its colourfulness at the first measurement. Figure 2.6: Dependent samples. In this example, we are comparing two means, just like the yellow versus red candy weight example, but now the samples for both measurements are the same. It is impossible to draw the sample for the second measurement independently from the sample for the first measurement if we want to compare repeated measurements. Here, the second sample is fixed once we have drawn the first sample. The samples are statistically dependent; they are paired samples. With dependent samples, probabilities have to be calculated in a different way, so we need a special sampling distribution. In the interactive content above, you may have noticed a relatively simple solution for two repeated measurements. We just calculate the difference between the two measurements for each candy in the sample and use the mean of this new difference variable as the sample statistic that we are interested in. The t-distribution, again, offers a good approximation of the sampling distribution of dependent samples if the samples are not too small. For other applications, the actual sampling distributions can become quite complicated but we do not have to worry about that. If we choose the right technique, our statistical software will take care of this. "],["2.4-spss-and-theoretical-approximation-of-the-sampling-distribution.html", "2.4 SPSS and Theoretical Approximation of the Sampling Distribution", " 2.4 SPSS and Theoretical Approximation of the Sampling Distribution By default, SPSS uses a theoretical probability distribution to approximate the sampling distribution. It chooses the correct theoretical distribution but you yourself should check if the conditions for using this distribution are met. For example, is the sample large enough or is it plausible that the variable is normally distributed in the population? In one case, SPSS automatically selects an exact approach if the conditions for a theoretical approximation are not met. If you apply a chi-squared test to a contingency table in SPSS, SPSS will automatically apply Fisher’s exact test if the table has two rows and two columns. In all other cases, you have to select bootstrapping or an exact approach yourself if the conditions for a theoretical approximation are not met. We are not going to practice with theoretical approximations in SPSS, now. Because theoretical approximation is the default approach in SPSS, we will encounter it in the exercises in later chapters. "],["2.5-boot-approx.html", "2.5 The Bootstrap Approximation of the Sampling Distribution", " 2.5 The Bootstrap Approximation of the Sampling Distribution The first way to obtain a sampling distribution is still based on the idea of drawing a large number of samples. However, we only draw one sample from the population for which we collect data. As a next step, we draw a large number of samples from our initial sample. The samples drawn in the second step are called bootstrap samples. The technique was developed by Bradley Efron (1979; 1987). For each bootstrap sample, we calculate the sample statistic of interest and we collect these as our sampling distribution. We usually want about 5,000 bootstrap samples for our sampling distribution. Figure 2.7: How do we create a sampling distribution with bootstrapping? In Figure 2.7, an initial sample (left panel) has been drawn from a population containing five candy colours in equal proportions. The bootstrap concept refers to the story in which Baron von Münchhausen saves himself by pulling himself and his horse by his bootstraps (or hair) out of a swamp. In a similar miraculous way, bootstrap samples resemble the sampling distribution even though they are drawn from a sample instead of the population. This miracle requires some explanation and it does not work always, as we will discuss in the remainder of this section. Picture: Baron von Münchhausen pulls himself and his horse out of a swamp. Theodor Hosemann (1807-1875), public domain, via Wikimedia Commons 2.5.1 Sampling with and without replacement As we will see in Chapter 3, for example Section 3.3, the size of a sample is very important to the shape of the sampling distribution. The sampling distribution of samples with twenty-five cases can be very different from the sampling distribution of samples with fifty cases. To construct a sampling distribution from bootstrap samples, the bootstrap samples must be exactly as large as the original sample. How can we draw many different bootstrap samples from the original sample if each bootstrap sample must contain the same number of cases as the original sample? Figure 2.8: Sampling with and without replacement. If we allow every case in the original sample to be sampled only once, each bootstrap sample contains all cases of the original sample, so it is an exact copy of the original sample. Thus, we cannot create different bootstrap samples. By the way, we often use the type of sampling described above, which is called sampling without replacement. If a person is (randomly) chosen for our sample, we do not put this person back into the population so she or he can be chosen again. We want our respondents to fill out our questionnaire only once or participate in our experiment only once. If we do allow the same person to be chosen more than once, we sample with replacement. The same person can occur more than once in a sample. Bootstrap samples are sampled with replacement from the original sample, so one bootstrap sample may differ from another. Some cases in the original sample may not be sampled for a bootstrap sample while other cases are sampled several times. You probably have noticed this in Figure 2.8. Sampling with replacement allows us to obtain different bootstrap samples from the original sample, and still have bootstrap samples of the same size as the original sample. In conclusion, we sample bootstrap samples in a different way (with replacement) than participants for our research (without replacement). 2.5.2 Limitations to bootstrapping Does the bootstrapped sampling distribution always reflect the true sampling distribution? Figure 2.9: How is bootstrapping influenced by sample size? In the population, twenty per cent of the candies are yellow. We can create a sampling distribution by sampling from our original sample with replacement. It is hardly a miracle that we obtain different samples with different sample statistics if we sample with replacement. Much more miraculous, however, is that this bootstrap distribution resembles the true sampling distribution that we would get if we draw lots of samples directly from the population. Does this miracle always happen? No. The original sample that we have drawn from the population must be more or less representative of the population. The variables of interest in the sample should be distributed more or less the same as in the population. If this is not the case, the sampling distribution may give a distorted view of the true sampling distribution. This is the main limitation to the bootstrap approach to sampling distributions. A sample is more likely to be representative of the population if the sample is drawn in a truly random fashion and if the sample is large. But we can never be sure. There always is a chance that we have drawn a sample that does not reflect the population well. 2.5.3 Any sample statistic can be bootstrapped The big advantage of the bootstrap approach (bootstrapping) is that we can get a sampling distribution for any sample statistic that we are interested in. Every statistic that we can calculate for our original sample can also be calculated for each bootstrap sample. The sampling distribution is just the collection of the sample statistics calculated for all bootstrap samples. Bootstrapping is more or less the only way to get a sampling distribution for the sample median, for example, the median weight of candies in a sample bag. We may create sampling distributions for the wildest and weirdest sample statistics, for instance the difference between sample mean and sample median squared. I would not know why you would be interested in the squared difference of sample mean and median, but there are very interesting statistics that we can only get at through bootstrapping. A case in point is the strength of an indirect effect in a mediation model (Chapter 11).

In principle, any sample statistic can be bootstrapped. SPSS, however, does not bootstrap sample statistics that we had better not use because they give bad (biased) results. For example, SPSS does not bootstrap the minimum value, maximum value or the range between minimum and maximum value of a variable. SPSS reports bootstrapping results as confidence intervals. We will discuss confidence intervals in detail in the next chapter.

Figure 2.12: Diagram for selecting the type of sampling distribution. By default, SPSS uses a theoretical approximation of the sampling distribution. Select the right test in SPSS and SPSS ensures that an appropriate theoretical probability distribution is used. You, however, must check whether the sample meets the conditions for using this theoretical probability distribution, see Table 2.2. If the conditions for using a theoretical probability distribution are not met or if we do not have a theoretical approximation to the sampling distribution, we use bootstrapping or an exact approach. We can always use bootstrapping but an exact approach is available only if the variables are categorical. An exact approach is more accurate than bootstrapping and approximation with a theoretical probability distribution, for example, the chi-squared distribution, so we prefer the exact approach over bootstrapping if we are dealing with categorical variables. "],["2.8-take-home-points-1.html", "2.8 Take-Home Points", " 2.8 Take-Home Points We may create an exact sampling distribution or simulate a bootstrap sampling distribution in simple situations or if we have a lot of computing power. For a bootstrap sampling distribution, we need about 5,000 bootstrap samples from our original sample. An exact sampling distribution can only be used with categorical variables. We can often approximate the sampling distribution of a sample statistic with a known theoretical probability distribution. Approximations only work well under conditions, which we have to check. Conditions usually involve the size of the sample, sample type (independent vs. dependent/paired), and the shape or variance of the population distribution. If these conditions are not met or we do not have a theoretical approximation to the sampling distribution, we use bootstrapping or exact tests. Samples are independent if, in principle, we can draw a sample for one group without taking into account the sample for another group of cases. Otherwise, the samples are dependent or paired. "],["3-param-estim.html", "Chapter 3 Estimating a Parameter: Which Population Values Are Plausible?", " Chapter 3 Estimating a Parameter: Which Population Values Are Plausible? Key concepts: point estimate, interval estimate, confidence (level), precision, standard error, critical value, confidence interval. Summary Given our sample, what are plausible population values? In this chapter, we set out to make educated guesses of a population value (parameter, often called “the true value”) based on our sample. This type of guessing is called estimation. Our first guess will be a single value for the population value. We merely guess that the population value is equal to the value of the sample statistic. This guess is the most precise guess that we can make, but, most likely, it is wrong. Our second guess uses the sampling distribution to make a statement about the approximate population value. In essence, we calculate an interval that we are confident will contain the population value. We can increase our confidence by widening the interval, but this decreases the precision of our guess. "],["3.1-point-estimate.html", "3.1 Point Estimate", " 3.1 Point Estimate If we have to name one value for the population value, our best guess is the value of the sample statistic. For example, if 18% of the candies in our sample bag are yellow, our best guess for the proportion of yellow candies in the population of all candies from which this bag was filled, is .18. What other number can we give if we only have our sample? This type of guess is called a point estimate and we use it a lot. The sample statistic is the best estimate of the population value only if the sample statistic is an unbiased estimator of the population value. As we have learned in Section 1.2.5, the true population value is equal to the mean of the sampling distribution for an unbiased estimator. The mean of the sampling distribution is the expected value for the sample. In other words, an unbiased estimator neither systematically overestimates the population value, nor does it systematically underestimate the population value. With an unbiased estimator, then, there is no reason to prefer a value higher or lower than the sample value as our estimate of the population value. Even though the value of the statistic in the sample is our best guess, it is very unlikely that our sample statistic is exactly equal to the population value (parameter). The recurrent theme in our discussion of random samples is that a random sample differs from the population because of chance during the sampling process. The precise population value is highly unlikely to actually appear in our sample. The sample statistic value is our best point estimate but it is nearly certain to be wrong. It may be slightly or far off the mark but it will hardly ever be spot on. For this reason, it is better to estimate a range within which the population value falls. Let us turn to this in the next section. "],["3.2-interval-estimate-for-the-sample-statistic.html", "3.2 Interval Estimate for the Sample Statistic", " 3.2 Interval Estimate for the Sample Statistic The sampling distribution of a continuous sample statistic tells us the probability of finding a range of scores for the sample statistic in a random sample. For example, the average weight of candies in a sample bag is a continuous random variable. The sampling distribution tells us the probability of drawing a sample with average candy weight between 2.0 and 3.6 grams. We can use this range as our interval estimate. Note that we are reasoning from sampling distribution to sample now. This is not what we want to do in actual research, where we want to reason from sample to sampling distribution to population. We get to that in Section 3.5. For now, assume that we know the true sampling distribution. Remember that the average or expected value of a sampling distribution is equal to the population value if the estimator is unbiased. For example, the mean weight of yellow candies averaged over a very large number of samples is equal to the mean weight of yellow candies in the population. For an interval estimate, we now select the sample statistic values that are closest to the average of the sampling distribution. Between which boundaries do we find the sample statistic values that are closest to the population value? Of course, we have to specify what we mean by “closest”. Which part of all samples do we want to include? A popular proportion is 95%, so we want to know the boundary values that include 95% of all samples that are closest to the population value. For example, between which boundaries is average candy weight situated for 95% of all samples that are closest to the average candy weight in the population? Figure 3.1: Within which interval do we find the sample results that are closest to the population value? Figure 3.1 shows the sampling distribution of average sample candy weight. Say, for instance, that 95% of all possible samples in the middle of the sampling distribution have an average candy weight ranging from 1.6 to 4.0 grams. The proportion .95 can be interpreted as a probability. Our sampling distribution tells us that we have 95% probability that the average weight of yellow candies lies between 1.6 and 4.0 grams in a random sample that we draw from this population. We now have boundary values, that is, a range of sample statistic values, and a probability of drawing a sample with a statistic falling within this range. The probability shows our confidence in the estimate. It is called the confidence level of an interval estimate. "],["3.3-precisionsesamplesize.html", "3.3 Precision, Standard Error, and Sample Size", " 3.3 Precision, Standard Error, and Sample Size The width of the estimated interval represents the precision of our estimate. The wider the interval, the less precise our estimate. With a less precise interval estimate, we will have to take into account a wider variety of outcomes in our sample. Figure 3.2: How does the confidence level affect the precision of an interval estimate? If we want to predict something, we value precision. We would rather conclude that the average weight of candies in the next sample we draw is between 2.0 and 3.6 grams than between 1.6 and 4.0 grams. If we would be satisfied with a very imprecise estimate, we need not do any research at all. With relatively little knowledge about the candies that we are investigating, we could straightaway predict that the average candy weight is between zero and ten grams. The goal of our research is to find a more precise estimate. There are several ways to increase the precision of our interval estimate, that is, to obtain a narrower interval for our estimate. The easiest and least useful way is to decrease our confidence that our estimate is correct. If we lower the confidence that we are right, we can discard a large number of other possible sample statistic outcomes and focus on a narrower range of sample outcomes around the true population value. This method is not useful because we sacrifice our confidence that the range includes the outcome in the sample that we are going to draw. What is the use of a more precise estimate if we are less certain that it predicts correctly? Therefore, we usually do not change the confidence level and leave it at 95% or thereabouts (90%, 99%). It is important to be quite sure that our prediction will be right. 3.3.1 Sample size A less practical but very useful method of narrowing the interval estimate is increasing sample size. If we buy a larger bag containing more candies, we get a better idea of average candy weight in the population and a better idea of the averages that we should expect in our sample. Figure 3.3: How does sample size affect the precision of an interval estimate? Figure 3.3 shows a sampling distribution of average candy weight in candy sample bags. The size of the horizontal arrow represents the precision of the interval estimate: the shorter the arrow, the more precise the interval estimate. As you may have noticed while playing with Figure 3.3, a larger sample yields a narrower, that is, more precise interval. You may have expected intuitively that larger samples give more precise estimates because they offer more information. This intuition is correct. In a larger sample, an observation above the mean is more likely to be compensated by an observation below the mean. Just because there are more observations, it is less likely that we sample relatively high scores but no or considerably fewer scores that are relatively low. The larger the sample, the more the distribution of scores for a variable in the sample will resemble the distribution of scores for this variable in the population. As a consequence, a sample statistic value will be closer to the population value for this statistic. Larger samples resemble the population more closely, and therefore large samples drawn from the same population are more similar. The result is that the sample statistic values in the sampling distribution are less varied and more similar. They are more concentrated around the true population value. The middle 95% of all sample statistic values are closer to the centre, so the sampling distribution is more peaked. 3.3.2 Standard error The concentration of sample statistic values, such as average candy weight in a sample bag, around the centre (mean) of the sampling distribution is expressed by the standard deviation of the sampling distribution. Up until now, we have only paid attention to the centre of the sampling distribution, its mean, because it is the expected value in a sample and it is equal to the population value if the estimator is unbiased. Now, we start looking at the standard deviation of the sampling distribution as well, because it tells us how precise our interval estimate is going to be. The sampling distribution’s standard deviation is so important that it has received a special name: the standard error. Figure 3.4: How does sample size affect the standard error? The word error reminds us that the standard error represents the size of the error that we are likely to make (on average under many repetitions) if we use the value of the sample statistic as a point estimate for the population value. Let us assume, for instance, that the standard error of the average weight of candies in samples is 0.6. Loosely stated, this means that the average difference between true average candy weight and average candy weight in a sample is 0.6 if we draw very many samples from the same population. The smaller the standard error, the more the sample statistic values resemble the true population value, and the more precise our interval estimate is with a given confidence level, for instance, 95%. Because we like more precise interval estimates, we prefer small standard errors over high standard errors. It is easy to obtain smaller standard errors: just increase sample size. See Figure 3.3, where larger samples yield more peaked sampling distributions. In a peaked distribution, values are closer to the mean and the standard error is smaller. In our example, average candy weights in larger sample bags are closer to the average candy weight in the population. In practice, however, it is both time-consuming and expensive to draw a very large sample. Usually, we want to settle on the optimal size of the sample, namely a sample that is large enough to have interval estimates at the confidence level and precision that we need but as small as possible to save on time and expenses. We return to this matter in Chapter 4.1.6. The standard error may also depend on other factors, such as the variation in population scores. In our example, more variation in the weight of candies in the population produces a larger standard error for average candy weight in a sample bag. If there are more very heavy candies and very light candies, it is easier to draw a sample with several heavy candies or with several very light candies. Average weight in these sample bags will be too high or too low. We cannot influence the variation in candy weights in the population, so let us ignore this factor influencing the standard error. "],["3.4-crit-values.html", "3.4 Critical Values", " 3.4 Critical Values In the preceding section, we learned that the standard error is related to the precision of the interval estimate. A larger standard error yields a less precise estimate, that is, with a wider interval estimate. We are interested in the interval that includes a particular percentage of all samples that can be drawn, usually the 95% of all samples that are closest to the population value. In our current example, the 95% of all samples with average candy weight that is closest to average candy weight in the population (2.8 grams). In theoretical probability distributions like the normal distribution, the percentage of samples is related to the standard error. If we know the standard error, we know the interval within which we find the 95% of samples that are closest to the population value. Figure 3.5: Standardized sample outcomes and the standard error. Figure 3.5 shows the sampling distribution of average candy weight per sample bag. It contains two horizontal axes, one with average candy weight in grams (bottom) and one with average candy weight in standard errors, also called z scores (top). In Figure 3.5, we approximate the sampling distribution with a theoretical probability distribution, namely the normal distribution. The theoretical probability distribution links probabilities (areas under the curve) to sample statistic outcome values (scores on the horizontal axis). For example, we have 2.5% probability of drawing a sample bag with average candy weight below 1.2 grams or 2.5% probability of drawing a sample bag with average candy weight over 4.4 grams. 3.4.1 Standardization and z scores The average candy weights that are associated with 2.5% and 97.5% probabilities in Figure 3.5 depend on the sample that we have drawn. As you may notice while playing with Figure 3.3, changing the size of the sample also changes the average candy weights that mark the 2.5% and 97.5% probabilities. We can simplify the situation if we standardize the sampling distribution: Subtract the mean of the sampling distribution from each sample mean in this distribution, and divide the result by the standard error. Thus, we transform the sampling distribution into a distribution of standardized scores. The mean of the new standardized variable is always zero. If we use the normal distribution for standardized scores, which is called the standard-normal distribution or z distribution, there is a single z value that marks the boundary between the top 2.5% and the bottom 97.5% of any sample. This z value is 1.96. If we combine this value with -1.96, separating the bottom 2.5% of all samples from the rest, we obtain an interval [-1.96, 1.96] containing 95% of all samples that are closest to the mean of the sampling distribution. In a standard-normal or z distribution, 1.96 is called a critical value. Together with its negative (-1.96), it separates the 95% sample statistic outcomes that are closest to the parameter, hence that are most likely to appear, from the 5% that are furthest away and least likely to appear. There are also critical z values for other probabilities, for instance, 1.64 for the middle 90% of all samples and 2.58 for the middle 99% in a standard-normal distribution. 3.4.2 Interval estimates from critical values and standard errors Critical values in a theoretical probability distribution tell us the boundaries, or range, of the interval estimate expressed in standard errors. In a normal distribution, 95% of all sample means are situated no more than 1.96 standard errors from the population mean. If the standard error is 0.5 and the population mean is 2.8 grams, we have 95% probability that the mean candy weight in a sample that we draw from this population lies between 1.82 grams (this is 1.96 times 0.5 subtracted from 2.8) and 3.78 grams. Critical values make it easy to calculate an interval estimate if we know the standard error. Just take the population value and add the critical value times the standard error to obtain the upper limit of the interval estimate. Subtract the critical value times the standard error from the population value to obtain the lower limit. Lower limit of the interval estimate = population value – critical value * standard error. Upper limit of the interval estimate = population value + critical value * standard error. (Standard) normal distributions make life easier for us, because there is a fixed critical value for each probability, such as 1.96 for 95% probability, which is well-worth memorizing. "],["3.5-ci-parameter.html", "3.5 Confidence Interval for a Parameter", " 3.5 Confidence Interval for a Parameter Working through the preceding sections, it may have occurred to you that it is all very well to be able to estimate the value of a statistic in a new sample with a particular precision and probability, but that this is not what we are interested in because it is not what reality is. Instead, in reality, we do not know the population parameter thus the goal of statistics to estimate this population parameter. For example, we don’t care much about the average weight of candies in our sample bag or in the next sample bag that we may buy. We want to say something about the average weight of candies in the population. How can we do this? In addition, you may have realized that, if we want to construct the sampling distribution of sample means, we first need to know the precise population value, for instance, average candy weight in the population. After all, the average of the sampling distribution is equal to the population mean for an unbiased estimator. In the preceding paragraphs, we acted as if we knew the sampling distribution of sample means. Figure 3.6: Probabilities of a sample with a particular number of yellow candies if 20 per cent of the candies are yellow in the population. In the exact approach to the sampling distribution of the proportion of yellow candies in a sample bag (Figure 3.6), for instance, we first need to know the proportion of yellow candies in the population. If we know the population proportion, we can calculate the exact probability of getting a sample bag with a particular proportion of yellow candies. But we don’t know the population proportion of yellow candies; we want to estimate it. In the candy weight example, we first need to know the mean of population candy weight, then we can construct a theoretical probability distribution of sample means. But we do not know the population mean; we want to estimate it. A theoretical probability distribution can only be used as an approximation of a sampling distribution if we know some characteristics of the population. We know that the sampling distribution of sample means always has the bell shape of a normal distribution or t distribution. However, knowing the shape is not sufficient for using the theoretical distribution as an approximation of the sampling distribution. We must also know the population mean because it specifies where the centre of the sampling distribution is located. So, we must know the population mean to use a theoretical probability distribution to estimate the population mean. By the way, we also need the standard error to know how peaked or flat the bell shape is. The standard error can usually be estimated from the data in our sample. But let us not worry about how the standard error is being estimated and focus on estimating the population mean. 3.5.1 Reverse reasoning from one sample mean Figure 3.7: Confidence intervals from replications Recall that before section 3.5, we were reasoning from population mean to sampling distribution of sample means, then to a single sample mean. Based on the known population mean and standard error, we can draw an interval estimate around the population mean on sampling distribution (Figure 3.5). 95% of all sample means will fall into this interval estimate around the known population mean. In reality, we do not know the population mean. We only know one sample mean from the data we currently collect. How can we estimate the population mean? We reserve what we did: instead of checking whether a sample mean is inside or outside of the interval estimate around the population mean (refer to 3.4), we shift the same interval estimate around that one sample mean, and check whether the interval estimate around this sample mean catches the population mean. These two ways of checking are equivalent. But the second way does not require us to know the population mean anymore if we replicate data collection many times. This is because if we shift the interval estimate around sample means, 95 percent of times, these interval estimates around sample means will catch the population mean, regardless of the population mean is known or not. We call the interval estimate around a sample mean confidence interval. The Figure 3.7(new) illustrates the reasoning from sample means to sampling distribution of sample means. The Figure 3.7 starts with one time data collection of 30 samples drawn from a population distribution (the top plot). From these 30 samples, we can calculate a sample mean and its 95% confidence interval around it. This can be illustrated with the first data collection: average candy weight in 30 samples is 2.95 grams and the lower and upper boundary for 95% confidence interval are 2.59 grams and 3.32 grams. We use a vertical dash line here to indicate that we pretend to know this population mean, which is equal to 3 grams, but in reality, we do not know. We can see in the middle plot, this 95% confidence interval catches the blue dash line, aka, the population mean. Let’s increase the number of times of data collection (replications!). Again, in each data collection, samples are drawn and recorded, the sample mean and 95% confidence interval around the sample mean are calculated. With more replications, the middle plot now shows how many 95% confidence intervals catch the population mean (indicated with green lines if yes, red lines if no). More times you replicate data collection, the percentage of all 95%CIs that catch the population mean gets closer to 95%. Let’s also increase sample size for each data collection. We see that in the middle plot all confidence intervals become narrower and, in the bottom plot the sampling distribution of sample means (the shape with green line) also becomes narrower. This sampling distribution is theoretically approximated by a normal distribution whose mean is the population mean and standard deviation is standard error. The bottom plot also shows the histogram which consists of sample means from replications. Each sample mean comes from one replication. As the number of replications and sample size increase, the shape of histogram gets closer to the shape of theoretical sampling distribution of sample means (the shape with green line). We are using the normal distribution to approximate the sampling distribution of the sample means. To make our life easier, we can convert the sampling distribution, which is a normal distribution, to the standard normal distribution. How? We convert every sample mean to a z score by substracting the mean of sampling distribution of sample means (this is not in the vicious circle if we collect data for many times) from it, then divided by standard error. The critical z value 1.96 and -1.96 together marks the upper and lower limit of the interval containing 95% of all samples with means closest to the population mean. The critical z value 1.65 and -1.65 together marks the upper and lower limit of the interval containing 90% of all samples with means closest to the population mean. As a consequence, we are able to calculate 95% confidence interval around a sample mean by adding and subtracting 1.96 standard errors from that sample mean. This is much more efficient than selecting a lot of imaginary population means! Confidence interval lower limit = sample value – critical value * standard error. Confidence interval upper limit = sample value + critical value * standard error. For example, the 95%-confidence interval for a sample mean: Lower limit = sample mean - 1.96 * standard error. Upper limit = sample mean + 1.96 * standard error. Haven’t we seen this calculation before? Yes we did, in Section 3.4.2, where we estimated the interval around population mean for sample means. We now simply reverse the calculation, using the interval of sample mean to estimate the population mean instead of the other way around. 3.5.2 One confidence interval does not say anything It is very important that we understand that the confidence level 95% is NOT the probability that the population parameter has a particular value, or that it falls within the interval. In classic statistics (so called “Frequentists”), the population parameter is not a random variable but a fixed, unknown number, which does not have a probability. A confidence interval around a sample statistics from solely one data collection either catches (100%) or does not catch (0%) the population parameter. We just do not know which one is the case. That’s why we cannot make any conclusion about the population mean based on one confidence interval. Only when we replicate data collection many many times, we do know that about 95% of all 95% confidence intervals will catch the population mean. If we were to repeat the experiment over and over, then 95% of the time the confidence intervals contain the true mean. Hoekstra, Morey, Rouder, &amp; Wagenmakers (2014) Jerzy Neyman introduced the concept of a confidence interval in 1937: “In what follows, we shall consider in full detail the problem of estimation by interval. We shall show that it can be solved entirely on the ground of the theory of probability as adopted in this paper, without appealing to any new principles or measures of uncertainty in our judgements”. (Jerzy Neyman, 1937: 347) Photo of Jerzy Neyman by Ohonik, Commons Wikimedia, CC BY-SA 4.0] 3.5.3 Confidence intervals with bootstrapping If we approximate the sampling distribution with a theoretical probability distribution such as the normal (z) or t distribution, critical values and the standard error are used to calculate the confidence interval (see Section 3.5.1). There are theoretical probability distributions that do not work with a standard error, such as the F distribution or chi-squared distribution. If we use those distributions to approximate the sampling distribution of a continuous sample statistic, for instance, the association between two categorical variables, we cannot use the formula for a confidence interval (Section 3.5.1) because we do not have a standard error. We must use bootstrapping to obtain a confidence interval. As you might remember from Section 2.5, we simulate a sampling distribution if we bootstrap a statistic, for instance median candy weight in a sample bag. We can use this sampling distribution to construct a confidence interval. For example, we take the values separating the bottom 2.5% and the top 2.5% of all samples in the bootstrapped sampling distribution as the lower and upper limits of the 95% confidence interval. We will encounter the bootstrapping method for confidence intervals around regression coefficient of mediator again in chapter 11. It is also possible to construct the entire sampling distribution in exact approaches to the sampling distribution. Both the standard error and percentiles can be used to create confidence intervals. This can be very demanding in terms of computer time, so exact approaches to the sampling distribution usually only report p values (see Section ??), not confidence intervals.

A point estimate may come close to the population value but it is almost certainly not correct. A 95% confidence interval is an interval estimate of the population value. We are 95% confident that the population value lies within this interval. Note that confidence is not a probability! A larger sample or a lower confidence level yields a narrower, that is, a more precise confidence interval. A larger sample yields a smaller standard error, which yields a more precise confidence interval because the limits of a 95% confidence interval fall one standard error times the critical value below and above the value of the sample statistic.

Watch this micro lecture on hypothesis testing for an overview of the chapter. Summary Is my sample probable if the null hypothesis is true? In the preceding chapter, we have learned that a confidence interval contains the population values that are plausible, given the sample that we have drawn. In the current chapter, we narrow this down to the question whether the expectation of the researcher about the population is plausible. The expectation is usually called a (research) hypothesis and it must be translated into statistical hypotheses about a population value (parameter): a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis. We test a null hypothesis in the following way. We construct a sampling distribution in one of the ways we have learned in Chapter 2 using the value specified in the null hypothesis as the hypothetical population value. In other words, we act as if the null hypothesis is true. Then, we calculate the probability of drawing a sample such as the one we have drawn or a sample that differs even more from the hypothesized population value. If this probability (p value) is very low, say, below 5%, we reject the null hypothesis because our sample would be too unlikely if the null hypothesis is true. In this case, the test is statistically significant. The probability threshold that we use is called the significance level of the test. "],["4.1-null-hypothesis-significance-testing.html", "4.1 Null Hypothesis Significance Testing", " 4.1 Null Hypothesis Significance Testing Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) is the most widely used method for statistical inference in the social sciences and beyond. The logic underlying NHST is called the Neyman Pearson approach (Lehmann, 1993). Though these names are not widely known, the work of Jerzy Neyman (1894–1981) and Egon Pearson (1895–1980) still has a profound impact on the way current research is conducted, reviews are considered, and papers are published. Our habit of formulating a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis for all situations not covered by the null hypothesis is generally attributed to the statistician R.A. Fisher. This, however, is not entirely correct (see, e.g., Halpin &amp; Stam, 2006). Fisher introduced the concept of a null hypothesis (Ronald Aylmer Fisher, 1935: 18) but not the concept of an alternative hypothesis. The statisticians Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson introduced the idea of working with two or more hypotheses. But the two hypotheses do not cover all possible population values and they were usually not called a null and alternative hypothesis. They specify two or more different population values. A statistical test is used to determine which of the hypotheses fits the sample best. (J. Neyman &amp; Pearson, 1933) Egon Pearson. Photo by Grasso Luigi, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 4.0 The Neyman Pearson approach ensures tight control on the probability of making correct and incorrect decisions. It is a decision framework that gives you a clear criteria and also an indication of what the probability is that your decision is wrong. The decision in this regard, is either the acceptance or rejection of the \\(H_0\\) hypothesis. The Neyman Pearson approach is about choosing your desired probability of making correct and incorrect decisions, setting up the right conditions for this, and making a decision. It considers the following: Alpha - Determine your desired risk of drawing the wrong conclusion. Power - Determine your desired probability of drawing the correct conclusion. Determine the sample size needed to achieve this. Conduct your research with this sample size. Determine the test statistic. Determine if \\(p\\)-value \\(\\leq \\alpha\\). If so, reject \\(H_0\\). The two decisions can be visualized in a \\(2 \\times 2\\) table where in reality \\(H_0\\) can be true or false (\\(H_A\\) is true), and the decision can either be to reject \\(H_0\\) or not. Figure 4.1 illustrates the correct and incorrect decisions that can be made. The green squares obviously indicate that it is a good decision to reject \\(H_0\\) when it is infact false, and not to reject \\(H_0\\) if it is in reality true. And the red squares indicate that it is a wrong decision to reject \\(H_0\\) when it is actually true (Type I error), or not reject \\(H_0\\) if it is in reality false (Type II error). Figure 4.1: NHST decision table. Intuitively it is easy to understand that you would want the probability of an incorrect decision to be low, and the probability of a correct decision to be high. But how do we actually set these probabilities? Lets consider the amount of yellow candies from the candy factory again. In chapter 1.2 we learned that the factory produces candy bags where one fifth of the candies are supposed to be yellow. Now suppose we don’t know this and our null hypothesis would be that half or the candies would be yellow. In figure 1.4 you can set the parameter values to .5 and .2 and see what the discreet probability distributions look like. As the candy factory produces bags with ten candies, we can look at both probability distributions. Figure 4.2 shows both distributions. \\(H_0\\) Distribution Half of the candies in the bag are yellow The parameter of the candy machine is .5 With expected value 5 out of 10 \\(H_A\\) Distribution One fifth of the candies in the bag are yellow The parameter of the candy machine is .2 With expected value 2 out of 10 Figure 4.2: Discrete binomial distributions We will use both distributions in figure 4.2 to clarify the different components within the Neyman Pearson approach later in this chapter. For now, take a good look at both probability distributions, and consider a bag of candy containing 4 yellow candies. Are you able to determine if this bag is the result of a manufacturing process that produces bags with 20% or 50% yellow candies. Doing research is essentially the same. You collect one sample, and have to determine if the effect of your study is non existent (\\(H_0 = \\text{true}\\)) or that there is something going on (\\(H_0 \\neq \\text{true}\\)). Statistical hypotheses come in pairs: a null hypothesis (H0) and an alternative hypothesis (H1 / HA). We met the null hypothesis in the preceding sections. We use it to create a (hypothetical) sampling distribution. To this end, a null hypothesis must specify one value for the population statistic that we are interested in, for example, .5 or .2 as the proportion of yellow candies. 4.1.1 Null hypothesis The null hypothesis reflects the skeptical stance in research. It assumes that there is nothing going on. There is no difference between experimental condition, there is no correlation between variables, there is no predictive value to your regression model, a coin is fair, and so forth. Though a null hypothesis can be expressed as a single value, that does not mean that we always get that specific value when we take a random sample. If our null assumption of our candy factory machine is that it produces bags with 5 out of 10 yellow candies, then there is still a chance that some bags will contain just one yellow candy of even 0 yellow candies. As can be seen in figure 4.3. Figure 4.3: Discrete binomial distributions 4.1.2 Alternative hypotesis The assumption that a researcher wants to test is called a research hypothesis. It is a statement about the empirical world that can be tested against data. Communication scientists, for instance, may hypothesize that: a television station reaches half of all households in a country, media literacy is below a particular standard (for instance, 5.5 on a 10-point scale) among children, opinions about immigrants are not equally polarized among young and old voters, the celebrity endorsing a fundraising campaign makes a difference to adult’s willingness to donate, more exposure to brand advertisements increases brand awareness among consumers, and so on. These are statements about populations: all households in a country, children, voters, adults, and consumers. As these examples illustrate, research hypotheses seldom refer to statistics such as means, proportions, variances, or correlations. Still, we need a statistic to test a hypothesis. The researcher must translate the research hypothesis into a new hypothesis that refers to a statistic in the population, for example, the population mean. The alternative hypothesis therefore indicates what the researcher expects in terms of effects, differences, deviation from null. It is the operationalisation of what you expect to find if your theory would be accurate. In case of our candy factory example, the alternative hypothesis would be that the machine produces bags with 2 out of 10 yellow candies and that the machines parameter is .2, one in five yellow candies per bag. Assuming this parameter, does not ensure that every bag will contain exactly 2 yellow candies. Some bags will contain 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or even 10 yellow candies. The probabilities for each can again be visualized using the exact discrete binomial probability distribution (figure 4.4) as we did for the null hypothesis. Figure 4.4: Discrete binomial distributions Note that both the probability distribution for \\(H_0\\) and for \\(H_A\\) contain the results of assumptions about reality, and that at this stage only the sample size, the amount of candies in a bag (10) has been used to determine the distribution. No data has been gathered yet in determining these distributions. It is all based on assumptions. 4.1.3 True effect size The true effect size is the difference between the null hypothesis and the true alternative hypothesis. In the candy factory example, the true effect size is .5 - .2 = .3. This is the difference in the proportion of yellow candies in the bags. In figure 4.5 you can see the difference in the two distributions. The true effect size is the difference in the expected value of the two distributions. In absolute terms, it it the 5 - 3, though, in terms of the parameter it is the proportion .5 - .2. Figure 4.5: Discrete binomial distributions True refers to the actual difference in the population. The problem is that we do not know this difference. In our candy factory example, we can only observe the specific candy bag. Have an assumption about the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. Though the true effect size refers only to the actual effect in the population, the actual difference, the actual correlation, the actual parameter value. Understanding the null and alternative hypothesis and their associated probability distributions is crucial for grasping the logic of the Neyman Pearson approach. In the following chapters, we will use these distributions to explain the different components of the Neyman Pearson approach. 4.1.4 Alpha The first step in the Neyman Pearson approach is to set the desired Type I error rate, also known as the significance level, \\(\\alpha\\). This is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is in reality true. In the \\(2 \\times 2\\) descision table in figure 4.6, this corresponds to the top left quadrant. As a researcher, you decide how much risk you are willing to take to make a Type I error. As the Neyman Pearson approach is a decision framework, you have to set this probability before you start collecting data. The most common value for \\(\\alpha\\) is .05, which means that you accept a 5% chance of making a Type I error. .alpha { stroke: black;} #alpha > svg { transform: scale(.8);} Figure 4.6: NHST decision table. In our yellow candy example, assuming the null hypothesis to be true, relates to the parameter value of .5 and the associated probability distribution shown in figure 4.3. We have already determined that if \\(H_0\\) is true, it is still possible we could get a bag with 0 or 10 yellow candies. Deciding to reject the null hypothesis in any of these cases, would be wrong, because the null hypothesis is assumed to be true. The exact probabilities can be found on the y-axis of figure 4.3, and are also shown in the table 4.1 below. Looking at the probability of getting 0 or 10 candies in table 4.1, we see that together this amounts to .002 or 0.2%. If we would decide to only reject the null hypothesis if we would get 0 or 10 candies, this would be a wrong decision, but we would also know that the chance of such a decision is pretty low. Our Type I error, alpha, significance level, would be .002. Table 4.1: Probabilities of drawing a certain amount of yellow candies from a bag of 10 candies, assuming the null hypothesis to be true. Yellow 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Prob 0.001 0.010 0.044 0.117 0.205 0.246 0.205 0.117 0.044 0.010 0.001 Choosing such an alpha level would result in a threshold between 0 and 2 and 9 and 10. We call this the critical value associated with the chosen alpha level. Where on the outside of the threshold we would reject the null hypothesis, and inside the threshold we would not reject the null hypothesis. So, if that is our decision criteria, we would reject the null hypothesis if we would draw a bag with 0 or 10 yellow candies, and not reject the null hypothesis if we would draw a bag with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 yellow candies. Amounting to a Type I error rate of .002 or 0.2%. Figure 4.7 shows the critical values for the null hypothesis distribution, and indicate what de decision would be for values on the outside and inside of the decision boundary. Figure 4.7: H0 binomial distributions with critical values In the social sciences, we allow ourselves to make a wrong descision more often. We usually set the alpha level to .05. For our discreet example setting the alpha level to .05 is not really possible. Looking at table 4.1, we could raise the significance level to .044 if we would reject the null hypothesis if we would draw 0, 1, 2,, 8, 9 or 10 yellow candies. This would result in a Type I error rate of 4.4%. Though if we would also reject the null hypothesis with 3 or 7 yellow candies, we would have a Type I error rate of 5.7%. For a discrete probability distribution with a limited number of outcomes, it is not always possible to set the alpha level exactly to .05. For continuous probability distributions, such as the normal distribution, it is possible to set the alpha level exactly to .05. For example the null hypothesis that average media literacy in the population of children equals 5.5 on a scale from one to ten. We can construct a sampling distribution around the hypothesized population value. Remember (Section 1.2.4) that the population value is the expected value of the sampling distribution, that is, its mean (if the estimator is unbiased). The sampling distribution, then, is centered around the population value specified in the null hypothesis. This sampling distribution tells us the probabilities of all possible sample outcomes if the null hypothesis is true. It allows us to identify the most unlikely samples. In step two in figure 4.8, we set the alpha level to .05. This means that we cut off 2.5% of the area in each tail of the sampling distribution. The critical values are the values that separate the 2.5% of the area in each tail from the 95% of the area in the middle. If we assume the population parameter to be 5.5, rejecting the null hypothesis would again be a wrong decision. Thus setting the boundary by using an alpha level of .05, would yield a wrong decision in 5% of the samples we take. Just like the discrete candy color case, we decide to reject \\(H_0\\) on the outside of the critical value and not reject \\(H_0\\) on the inside of the critical value. Figure 4.8: Sampling distribution of average media literacy according to the null hypothesis. Note that the reasoning for the discrete case and the continuous case is the same. The only difference is that for the continuous case we can set the alpha level exactly to .05. 4.1.5 1 - Alpha The decision to not reject the null hypothesis when it is in reality true is indicated by \\(1 - \\alpha\\). It does not go by any other name, but in terms of probability, it is directly dependent on your desired type I error rate, your chosen alpha level. It therefore corresponds to probability of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 yellow candies in the candy factory example, a 99.8% (1 - .002) chance of making the correct decision. The inside of the critical value in figure 4.7 is the area where we do not reject the null hypothesis. In the \\(2 \\times 2\\) decision table in figure 4.1, this corresponds to the bottom left green quadrant. Now that we have determined our critical value based on our desired alpha, significance level, we can use this to look at the power. 4.1.6 Power The power refers to the probability of making the correct decision when the null hypothesis is false. In the \\(2 \\times 2\\) decision table in figure 4.1, this corresponds to the top right quadrant. As we have already set our decision criteria by choosing our alpha level in the previous step, we already know when we decide to reject the null. In figure (fig:nulldistributionalpha) we determined our type I error could be 0.2%, if we would reject the null hypothesis if we would draw 0 or 10 yellow candies. The critical value would in that case be between 0 and 1 and 9 and 10. This critical value carries over when determining the power. Though, as we assume the null hypothesis to be false, we need to specify what alternative distribution to use. We already established that this would be the distribution with a parameter value of .2. In figure 4.9, we see that our descision criteria is still the same. That we decide to reject the null when we sample 0 or 10 yellow candies. But the distribution has now changed. Figure 4.9: H0 binomial distributions with critical values If this alternative distribution would actually be true, deciding to reject the null would be a good decision. Though, we can also see that if this alternative is true, if the parameter turly is .2, getting a bag with 0 or 10 yellow candies does not happen that often. The probabilities for 10 yellow candies is almost none, and the probability for getting 0 yellow candies is about 11%. This means that if the alternative hypothesis is true, if our sample originates from the alternative hypothesis, we would only make the decision to reject the null hypothesis in 11% of the samples we get out of it. So, the power of the test, correctly rejecting the null when this specific alternative is true is only 11%. The only way to increase the power is to increase the sample size of the study. As stated earlier we would rather have a high probability of making the correct decision. In the social sciences we are striving for a power of .80. This means that we want to make the correct decision in 80% of the cases when the null hypothesis is false. In our candy factory example, this would mean that we would want to reject the null hypothesis in 80% of the replications. With our machine producing bags with 10 candies, this is just not possible. The only way to increase the power is to increase the sample size of the study. In the candy factory example, this would mean that we would have to increase the number of candies in the candy bags. We will come back to this in the chapter 3.3.1 on sample size. One more thing to note, is that the true power of the test is only known when the alternative hypothesis is true. In practice, we do not know if the null or the alternative hypothesis is true. We can only calculate the power of the test when we assume some alternative hypothesis. It is good practice to base your assumptions about the alternative hypothesis on previous research, theory, or other empirical evidence. This is mostly expressed as the expected effect size, the expected difference between the null and the alternative hypothesis. In all statistical software, the power of the test is not calculated based on the true effect size, but on the found effect size in your sample. This is called the observed power and will be covered in chapter 4.1.10. 4.1.7 Beta The probability of making a Type II error is indicated by \\(\\beta\\). It is the probability of not rejecting the null hypothesis when it is in reality false. In the \\(2 \\times 2\\) decision table in figure 4.1, this corresponds to the bottom right quadrant. The power of the test is \\(1 - \\beta\\). In our candy factory example, the power of the test is .11, so the probability of making a Type II error is .89. It is the probability of getting a bag with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 yellow candies, when the machine actually produces bags with 2 yellow candies, the addition of the height of the bars in figure 4.9 for these values. 4.1.8 Test statistic In chapter 1.2.1 we discussed the sample statistic, and defined it as any value describing a characteristic of the sample. This could be the mean, or the proportion, or the correlation, or the regression coefficient. It is a value that is calculated from the sample. Note that also conversions of the sample statistic, such as the difference between two sample means, or the ratio of two sample variances, \\(t\\)-values, \\(F\\)-values, and \\(\\chi^2\\)-values are also sample statistics. The test statistic is a sample statistic that is used to test the null hypothesis. In our candy factory example, the test statistic would be the number of yellow candies in the bag we sample. If we would draw a bag with 4 yellow candies, the test statistic would be 4. In the previous sections, we have determined our decision criteria, the critical value, based on our desired alpha level. We have also determined the power of the test, based on the alternative hypothesis. The test statistic is used to determine if we reject the null hypothesis or not. If the test statistic is outside the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis. If the test statistic is inside the critical value, we do not reject the null hypothesis. Looking at figure 4.7, we see that the critical value is between 0 and 1 and 9 and 10. If we would draw a bag with 4 yellow candies, we can check if the value 4 is inside or outside the critical value. As 4 is inside the critical value, we would not reject the null hypothesis. The test statistic is the value that is used to decide if we reject the null hypothesis or not. In the continuous case, as described in figure 4.8, the test statistic is the sample mean. If the sample mean is outside the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis. If the sample mean is inside the critical value, we do not reject the null hypothesis. If you select Step 4 in figure 4.8, and draw a few samples, you can see if the test statistic, the sample mean, is inside or outside the critical value. Again, the reasoning for the continuous case is the same as for the discrete case. 4.1.9 P-value How do we know that the test statistic that we have drawn is among the five percent most unlikely samples if the null hypothesis is true? In other words, how do we know that our sample statistic outcome is in the rejection region? The p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the result actually observed, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. We have learned that a test is statistically significant if the test statistic is in the rejection region. Statistical software, however, usually does not report the rejection region for the sample statistic. Instead, it reports the p value of the test, which is sometimes referred to as significance or Sig. in SPSS. In the previous section we considered a sample with 4 yellow candies. The p-value considers the probability of such a sample, but also ads the probability of getting a sample with less yellow candies. This is what is meant with “at least as extreme”. this is not really intuitive, but it refers to the less likely test statistics, in our case 0, 1, 2 and 3, are even less probable than 4. The assumption that the null hypothesis is true indicates that we need to look at the probabilities from the null distribution. Looking at table 4.1, we see that the probability of getting 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 yellow candies under the null distribution is 0.001 + 0.010 + 0.044 + 0.117 + 0.205 = 0.377. This is the p-value. The conditional probability of getting a sample that is as or less likely than the test statistic that we have. The conditional probability is referring to our assumption that the null hypothesis is true. The reasoning applied when comparing our test statistic to the critical value is the same as when comparing the p-value to the alpha level. If the p-value is smaller or equal to than the alpha level, we reject the null hypothesis. If the p-value is larger than the alpha level, we do not reject the null hypothesis. If the test statistic is within the critical values, the p-value is always larger than the alpha level. If the test statistic lies outside the critical value, the p-value is always smaller than the alpha level. In the case that the test statistic is exactly the same as the critical value, the p-value is exactly equal to the alpha level, we still decide to reject the null hypothesis. Reject \\(H_0\\) when \\(p\\)-value \\(\\leq \\alpha\\) As both the p-value and the alpha level assume the null to be true, you can find both probabilities under the null distribution. In the continuous case, the p-value is the area under the curve of the probability distribution that is more extreme than the sample mean. The significance level is chosen by you as a researcher and is fixed. It is important to remember that a p value is a probability under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. Therefore, it is a conditional probability. Compare it to the probability that we throw sixes with a dice. This probability is one out of six under the assumption that the dice is fair. Probabilities rest on assumptions. If the assumptions are violated, we cannot calculate probabilities. If the dice is not fair, we don’t know the probability of throwing sixes. In the same way, we have no clue whatsoever of the probability of drawing a sample like the one we have if the null hypothesis is not true in the population. Figure 4.10 shows a t-distribution for a null assumption with an alpha level of 5% (red area) and the p-value (blue area) for a random sample with a t-value of 2. For a two sided test (left) and a one sided test (right). We will cover one and two sided testing in chapter 4.1.14. Figure 4.10: T-distributions with alpha level and p-value In figure 4.10, the red vertical boundaries represent the critical value associated with a chosen alpha level of 5%, the red area under the curve. The blue vertical line represents the t-value from the sample, which in this example was 2. The blue area under the curve represents the p-value, the probability of getting this t-value or more extreme. Figure 4.11 representing the sampling distribution of average media literacy. You can take a sample and play around with the population mean according to some null hypothesis. If the mean in the sample is outside the critical value, it falls in the alpha rejection region. Figure 4.11: Sampling distribution of average media literacy according to the null hypothesis. The reasoning is again the same as in the discrete case. If the p-value is smaller or equal to the alpha level, we reject the null hypothesis. If the p-value is larger than the alpha level, we do not reject the null hypothesis. 4.1.10 Observed effect size In chapter 4.1.3 we discussed the true effect, the difference between the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. The problem is that we do not know the true effect, we do not know wich of the two hypothesis is actually true. In some cases we don’t even know if our expected alternative hypothesis is correct. We can only estimate the true effect using the sample statistic. The difference between the sample statistic and the null hypothesis is called the observed effect size. In the candy factory example, the observed effect size is the difference between the number of yellow candies in the sample and the number of yellow candies in the null hypothesis. If the null hypothesis is that the machine produces bags with 5 yellow candies, and the sample contains 4 yellow candies, the observed effect size is 1. The same defenition holds for the continuous case. If the null hypothesis is that the average media literacy in the population is 5.5, and the sample mean is 3.9, the observed effect size is 1.6. Or if we hypothesize that average candy weight in the population is 2.8 grams and we find an average candy weight in our sample bag of 2.75 grams, the effect size is -0.05 grams. If a difference of 0.05 grams is a great deal to us, the effect is practically relevant. Note that the effect sizes depend on the scale on which we measure the sample outcome. The unstandardized effect size of average candy weight changes if we measure candy weight in grams, micro grams, kilograms, or ounces. Of course, changing the scale does not affect the meaning of the effect size but the number that we are looking at is very different: 0.05 grams, 50 milligrams, 0.00005 kilos, or 0.00176 ounces. For this reason, we do not have rules of thumb for interpreting these unstandardized effect sizes in terms of small, medium, or large effects. But we do have rules of thumb for standardized effect sizes. You can imagine that estimating the true effect size on just one sample is not very reliable. The observed effect size could be the result of our sample being the result of the null being true, or the alternative being true. The way researchers try to get a notion of the true effect size is by replicating the study. If the observed effect size is consistent over multiple replications, we can be more confident that the average observed effect size is the true effect size. This is what we will cover in chapter 4.1.12 about meta analysis. 4.1.10.1 Standardized effect size: Cohen’s d for one or two means In scientific research, we rarely have precise norms for raw differences (unstandardized effects) that are practically relevant or substantial. For example, what would be a practically relevant attitude change among people exposed to a health campaign? To avoid answering this difficult question, we can take the variation in scores (standard deviation) into account. In the context of the candies example, we will not be impressed by a small difference between observed and expected (hypothesized) average candy weight if candy weights vary a lot. In contrast, if candy weight is quite constant, a small average difference can be important. For this reason, standardized effect sizes for sample means divide the difference between the sample mean and the hypothesized population mean by the standard deviation in the sample. Thus, we take into account the variation in scores. This standardized observed effect size for tests on one or two means is known as Cohen’s d. These are the formulas for Cohen’s d for a one-sample t test, a paired-samples t test, and an independent-samples t test (they will be provided if needed): \\[\\begin{equation} d_{one_-sample} = \\frac{M - \\mu_0}{SD} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} d_{paired_-samples} = \\frac{M_{diff} - \\mu_{0_-diff}}{SD_{diff}} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} d_{independent_-samples} = \\frac{2*t}{\\sqrt(df)} \\end{equation}\\] Where: \\(M\\) is the sample mean, \\(\\mu_0\\) is the hypothesized population mean, and \\(SD\\) is the standard deviation in the sample, \\(M_{diff}\\) is the difference between the two means in the sample, \\(\\mu_{0_-diff}\\) is the hypothesized difference between the two means in the population mean, which is zero in case of a nil hypothesis, and \\(SD_{diff}\\) is the standard deviation of the difference in the sample, \\(t\\) is the test statistic value and \\(df\\) is the number of degrees of freedom of the t test. The sample outcome can be a single mean, for instance the average weight of candies, but it can also be the difference between two means, for example, the difference in colourfulness of yellow candies at the beginning and end of a time period. In the latter case, the standard deviation that we need is the standard deviation of colourfulness difference across all candies (Section 2.3.6). In the case of independent samples, such as average weight of red versus yellow candies, we need a special combined (pooled) standard deviation for yellow and red candy weight that is not reported by SPSS. Here, we use the t value and degrees of freedom to calculate Cohen’s d. Using an inventory of published results of tests on one or two means, Cohen (1969) proposed rules of thumb for standardized effect sizes (ignore a negative sign if it occurs): 0.2: weak (small) effect, 0.5: moderate (medium) effect, 0.8: strong (large) effect. Note that Cohen’s d can take values above one. These are not errors, they reflect very strong or huge effects (Sawilowsky, 2009). 4.1.10.1.1 Obtaining Cohen’s d with SPSS Figure 4.12: Obtaining Cohen’s d with SPSS. Unfortunately, the t test commands in SPSS have no option to calculate Cohen’s d. It is, however, relatively easy to calculate Cohen’s d by hand from SPSS output. Remember that we must divide the unstandardized effect by the standard deviation. For a t test on one mean, the unstandardized effect is the difference between the sample mean and the hypothesized mean. SPSS reports this value in the column Mean Difference of the table with test results. Drop any negative signs! Divide it by the standard deviation of the variable as given in Table One-Sample Statistics. In the example, Cohen’s d is 0.036 / 0.169 = 0.21. This is a weak effect. For a paired-samples t test, the unstandardized effect size is reported in the column Mean in the Table Paired Samples Test. The standard deviation of the difference can be found in column Std. Deviation in the same table. Divide the first by the second, for instance, 1.880 / 1.033 = 1.82. This is a strong effect. For an independent-samples t test, the situation is less fortuitous because SPSS does not report the pooled sample standard deviation that we need. The pooled sample standard deviation takes a sort of average of the outcome variable’s standard deviations in the two groups. As an approximation, we can calculate Cohen’s d as follows: Double the t value and divide it by the square root of the degrees of freedom. In the example, Cohen’s d equals \\((2 * 0.651) / \\surd(18) = 0.31\\). This is a moderate effect size. 4.1.10.2 Association as effect size Measures of association such as Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient or Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient express effect size if the null hypothesis expects no correlation in the population. If zero correlation is expected, a correlation coefficient calculated for the sample expresses the difference between what is observed (sample correlation) and what is expected (zero correlation in the population). Effect size is also zero according to the standard null hypotheses used for tests on the regression coefficient (b), R2 for the regression model, and eta2 for analysis of variance. As a result, we can use the standardized regression coefficient (Beta in SPSS and b* according to APA), R2, and eta2 as standardized effect sizes. Because they are standardized, we can interpret their effect sizes using rules of thumb. The rule of thumb for interpreting a standardized regression coefficient (b*) or a correlation coefficient, for example, could be that a value between 0 and .10 is interpreted as no or a very weak association, between .10 and .30 as weak, between .30 and .50 as moderate, .50 to .80 as strong, and .80 to 1.00 as very strong, while exactly 1.00 is a perfect association. Note that we ignore the sign (plus or minus) of the effect when we interpret its size. 4.1.11 Post hoc power Just as the observed effect size is based on the test statistic acquired from your sample, so is the post hoc power. It is also known as: observed, retrospective, achieved, prospective and a priori power (O’Keefe, 2007). The power of a test assuming a population effect size equal to the observed effect size in the current sample. The post hoc power refers to the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis assuming the alternative hypothesis has a population mean equal to the observed sample mean or more accurately the observed test statistic. Though SPSS produces this when you ask it, it is obvious that multiple replications of a research study will yield different results. As the true population mean is not a random variable, the actual power is fixed and should not vary. Figure 4.13: Discrete binomial distributions showing post hoc power Figure 4.13 shows the post hoc power for a sample of 10 candies. The null hypothesis is that the machine produces bags with 5 yellow candies. The alternative hypothesis is that the machine produces bags with 2 yellow candies. But the post hoc power assumes the found test statistic of 4 candies to be the alternative population parameter of .4. Following the same decision criteria as defined in the previous sections, the post hoc power is almost zero. This is the probability of 0 or 1 yellow candies under the alternative distribution. You can imagine that if we look at a different candy bag and we would find 7 yellow candies, the post hoc power would be not be the same higher. The post hoc power does not have much practical use, though you should be warned that this is what SPSS produces when you ask for power. 4.1.12 Meta analysis As mentioned in chapter 4.1.10, the observed effect size is based on the sample statistic, and will differ with every sample you take. If our research hypothesis is actually true, than a random sample from the alternative distribution would more often result in sampled number of yellow candies close to 2. But as we have seen in figure 4.4, getting 4 yellow candies is reasonably probable. Now imagine that we would take multiple samples from the alternative distribution, and calculate the observed effect size for each sample. If we would plot these observed effect sizes, we would get a sampling distribution of observed effect sizes. In research we conduct replication studies to see if the observed effect size is consistent over multiple replications. If this is the case, we can be more confident that the average observed effect size is the true effect size and we can determine the parameter of the alternative hypothesis. Again imagine that we get a hundred bags of candy and we consistently find 7 to 9 yellow candies, this would give us an indication of the true effect size being 8. It would also indicate that our initial alternative hypothesis is highly unlikely. This is essentially what meta analysis is about. Collecting effect sizes from multiple studies and combining them to get an indication of the true effect size. [to-do] add communication meta analysis example. 4.1.13 Sample size As stated in chapter 4.1.6, the only way to increase the power of a test is to increase the sample size. In the candy factory example, the sample size is the total number of candies in the bag. With only 10 candies in the bag, the power of the test is only 0.11. To reach our desired power of 80%, we clearly need to increase the sample size. In figure 4.14, we increased the number of candies in the bag to 15. We can see on the x-axis that the posible outcome space for the number of yellow candies in the bag is now 0 to 15. This of still assumes our \\(H_0\\) to be true, and the parameter of the machine is still \\(\\theta = .5\\), half of the candies in the bag should be yellow. Though the parameter is still the same, the expected value when we have bags of 16 cancies is now \\(.5 \\times 20 = 10\\), right in the middle of our distribution. Figure 4.14 still follows the reasoning scheme we have setup earlier. We decide to reject \\(H_0\\) on the outside of our critical values (Red vertical line). We determined the position of the critical value based on our chosen alpha level. Becouse our outcome space is larger we can be more accurate in striving for an \\(\\alpha = .5\\). Our alpha is now 4.1%, we get this by adding the yellow bars 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 15 up unitil 20, under the null distribution. This is not exactly 5 percent, but shifting the critical value inwards, would make the alpha level to high. So, this is close enough. With this sample size, we can acquire our desired power of 80%. If we would assume our alternative hypothesis to be true, our decision to reject the null when you get 5 or less yellow candies, would be correct 80% of the time. The power of 80% is the sum of the light yellow bars under the assumption that \\(H_A\\) is true on the outside of our critical value. So, the power is the probability of getting 0, 1, 2, 3 ,4 ,5 or 15, 16,17, 18, 19 ,20 yellow candies under the alternative distribution. Figure 4.14: Discrete binomial distributions The same reasoning is applied to the continuous case. Let’s revisit the candy weight example. We could have a null hypothesis that the average yellow candy weight is the same as the weight of all other candy colors. But if in reality the yellow candies would be heavier, let’s say with an effect size of .3, we would need to determine what sample size we would need to get a power of 80% and a alpha of 5%. Figure 4.15 shows the relation between sample size, power, alhpa and effect size. You can play around with the sliders de determine what sample size you would need. Figure 4.15: How does test power depend on effect size, type of test, significance level, and sample size? Sampling distributions of the sample mean under the null hypothesis (H0, left-hand curve) and under the assumed true value of the population mean (H1, right-hand curve) for a one-sample t test. Just like the discrete case, we choose an alpha level, and we can see the critical value in the null distribution. The alpha level of 5% is the area under the curve of the null distributon on the outside of the critical values. The power is the area under the alternative distribution that is outside the critical values. The reasoning is again the same as in the discrete case. We first determine our desired alpha and power, make sure our sample size is large enough to get the desired power, for our effect size of interest. Then, when we collect our data, we can calculate our test statistic and determine if we can reject the null hypothesis or not, being confident theat we will be wrong in our conclusion in 5% of the cases, and that we will be right in 80% of the cases when the alternative hypothesis is actually true. 4.1.13.1 How to determine sample size As stated in chapter @ref(#power) about the power of a test, we already considered that we do not know the parameter for the alternative distribution and that we therefore also don’t know the true effect size. We stated that you can make an educated guess about the true effect size based on previous research, theory, or other empirical evidence. In research you can take these assumptions into account by conducting a power analysis. A power analysis is a statistical method to determine the sample size you need to get a desired power for a given effect size. It can be difficult to specify the effect size that we should expect or that is practically relevant. If there is little prior research comparable to our new project, we cannot reasonably specify an effect size and calculate sample size. Though, if there are meta analysis available for you research topic of interest or you have the effect sizes from a few previous studies, you can use GPower to calculate the sample size you need to get a desired power for a given effect size. GPower is a stand alone program that can be downloaded from the internet, and is specificly designed to calculate sample size for a wide range of statistical tests. Download G*Power here In GPower you can specify the test you want to conduct, the effect size you expect, the alpha level you want to use, and the power you want to achieve. GPower will then calculate the sample size you need to get the desired power for the given effect size. For our candy color example, we can use G*Power to calculate the sample size we need to get a power of 80% for a given effect size of .3. Figure 4.16: Power analysis in G*Power for a binomial distribution In figure 4.16 you can see that for the binomial test we have set the proportion p1 to .5 (\\(H_0\\)) and the proportion p2 (\\(H_A\\)) to .2, indirectly setting the effect size to .3. We have set the alpha level to 5% and the power to 80%. By hitting the calculate button, G*Power will calculate the sample size we need. In this case we need 20 candies in the bag to get a power of 80%. The plot shows exactly the same information as in figure 4.14, though with lines instead of bars. 4.1.14 One-Sided and Two-Sided Tests In the preceding section, you may have had some trouble when you were determining whether a research hypothesis is a null hypothesis or an alternative hypothesis. The research hypothesis stating that average media literacy is below 5.5 in the population, for example, represents the alternative hypothesis because it does not fix the hypothesized population value to one number. The accompanying null hypothesis must cover all other options, so it must state that the population mean is 5.5 or higher. But this null hypothesis does not specify one value as it should, right? This null hypothesis is slightly different from the ones we have encountered so far, which equated the population value to a single value. If the null hypothesis equates a parameter to a single value, the null hypothesis can be rejected if the sample statistic is either too high or too low. There are two ways of rejecting the null hypothesis, so this type of hypothesis and test are called two-sided or two-tailed. By contrast, the null hypothesis stating that the population mean is 5.5 or higher is a one-sided or one-tailed hypothesis. It can only be rejected if the sample statistic is at one side of the spectrum: only below (left-sided) or only above (right-sided) the hypothesized population value. In the media literacy example, the null hypothesis is only rejected if the sample mean is well below the hypothesized population value. A test of a one-sided null hypothesis is called a one-sided test. Figure 4.17: One-sided and two-sided tests of a null hypothesis. In a left-sided test of the media literacy hypothesis, the researcher is not interested in demonstrating that average media literacy among children can be larger than 5.5. She only wants to test if it is below 5.5, perhaps because an average score below 5.5 is alarming and requires an intervention, or because prior knowledge about the world has convinced her that average media literacy among children can only be lower than 5.5 on average in the population. If it is deemed important to note values well over 5.5 as well as values well below 5.5, the research and null hypotheses should be two-sided. Then, a sample average well above 5.5 would also have resulted in a rejection of the null hypothesis. In a left-sided test, however, a high sample outcome cannot reject the null hypothesis. 4.1.14.1 Boundary value as hypothesized population value Figure 4.18: Sampling distribution of average media literacy. You may wonder how a one-sided null hypothesis equates the parameter of interest with one value as it should. The special value here is 5.5. If we can reject the null hypothesis stating that the population mean is 5.5 because our sample mean is sufficiently lower than 5.5, we can also reject any hypothesis involving population means higher than 5.5. In other words, if you want to know if the value is not 5.5 or more, it is enough to find that it is less than 5.5. If it’s less than 5.5, then you know it’s also less than any number above 5.5. Therefore, we use the boundary value of a one-sided null hypothesis as the hypothesized value for the population in a one-sided test. 4.1.14.2 One-sided – two-sided distinction is not always relevant Note that the difference between one-sided and two-sided tests is only useful if we test a statistic against one particular value or if we test the difference between two groups. In the first situation, for example, if we test the null hypothesis that average media literacy is 5.5 in the population, we may only be interested in showing that the population value is lower than the hypothesized value. Another example is a test on a regression coefficient or correlation coefficient. According to the null hypothesis, the coefficient is zero in the population. If we only want to use a brand advertisement if exposure to the advertisement increases brand awareness among consumers, we apply a right-sided test to the coefficient for the effect of exposure on brand awareness because we are only interested in a positive effect (larger than the zero). In the second situation, we compare the scores of two groups on a dependent variable. If we compare average media literacy after an intervention to media literacy before the intervention (paired-samples t test), we must demonstrate an increase in media literacy before we are going to use the intervention on a large scale. Again, a one-sided test can be applied. In contrast, we cannot meaningfully formulate a one-sided null hypothesis if we are comparing three groups or more. Even if we expect that Group A can only score higher than Group B and Group C, what about the difference between Group B and Group C? If we can’t have meaningful one-sided null hypotheses, we cannot meaningfully distinguish between one-sided and two-sided null hypotheses. 4.1.14.3 From one-sided to two-sided p values and back again Statistical software like SPSS usually reports either one-sided or two-sided p values. What if a one-sided p value is reported but you need a two-sided p value or the other way around? In Figure 4.19, the sample mean is 3.9 and we have .015 probability of finding a sample mean of 3.9 or less if the null hypothesis is true. This probability is the surface under the curve to the left of the red line representing the sample mean. It is the one-sided p value that we obtain if we only take into account the possibility that the population mean can be smaller than the hypothesized value. We are only interested in the left tail of the sampling distribution. Figure 4.19: Halve a two-sided p value to obtain a one-sided p value, double a one-sided p value to obtain a two-sided p value. In a two-sided test, we have to take into account two different types of outcomes. Our sample outcome can be smaller or larger than the hypothesized population value. As a consequence, the p value must cover samples at opposite sides of the sampling distribution. We should not only take into account sample means that are smaller than 5.5 but also sample means that are just as much larger than the hypothesized population value. So our two-sided p value must include both the probability of .015 for the left tail and for the right tail of the distribution in Figure 4.19. We must double the one-sided p value to obtain the two-sided p value. In contrast, if our statistical software tells us the two-sided p value and we want to have the one-sided p value, we can simply halve the two-sided p value. The two-sided p value is divided equally between the left and right tails. If we are interested in just one tail, we can ignore the half of the p value that is situated in the other tail. Of course, this only makes sense if a one-sided test makes sense. Be careful if you divide a two-sided p value to obtain a one-sided p value. If your left-sided test hypothesizes that average media literacy is below 5.5 but your sample mean is well above 5.5, the two-sided p value can be below .05. But your left-sided test can never be significant because a sample mean above 5.5 is fully in line with the null hypothesis. Check that the sample outcome is at the correct side of the hypothesized population value. "],["4.2-using-confidence-intervals-to-test-hypotheses.html", "4.2 Using Confidence Intervals to test hypotheses", " 4.2 Using Confidence Intervals to test hypotheses 4.2.1 Estimation instead of hypothesis testing Following up on a report commissioned by the American Psychological Association APA (Wilkinson, 1999), the 6th edition of the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association recommends reporting and interpreting confidence intervals rather than relying solely on null hypothesis tests. Estimation is becoming more important: Assessing the precision of our statements about the population rather than just rejecting or not rejecting our hypothesis about the population. This is an important step forward and it is easy to accomplish if your statistical software reports confidence intervals. Figure 4.20: What is the most sensible interpretation of the results represented by the confidence interval for the regression coefficient, which estimates brand awareness from campaign exposure? Figure 4.20 shows six confidence intervals for a population value, for instance, the effect of exposure to advertisements on brand awareness, and the sample result as point estimate (dot). The horizontal axis is labeled by the size of the effect: the difference between the effect in the sample and the absence of an effect according to the null hypothesis. A confidence interval shows us whether or not our null hypothesis must be rejected (see Section 12.5.1). The rule is simple: If the value of the null hypothesis is within the confidence interval, the null hypothesis must not be rejected. By the way, note that a confidence interval allows us to test a null hypothesis other than the nil (Section 6.1.2). If we hypothesize that the effect of exposure on brand awareness is 0.1, we reject this null hypothesis if the confidence interval of the regression coefficient does not include 0.1. At the same time, however, confidence intervals allow us to draw a more nuanced conclusion. A confidence interval displays our uncertainty about the result. If the confidence interval is wide, we are quite uncertain about the true population value. If a wide confidence interval includes the null hypothesis near one of its boundaries (e.g., Confidence Interval D in Figure 4.20), we do not reject the null hypothesis but it still is plausible that the population value is substantially larger (or substantially smaller) than the hypothesized value. For example, we could interpret Confidence Interval D in Figure 4.20 in the following way: The effect of exposure to advertisements on brand awareness is of moderate size in the sample (b* = 0.28). It is, however, not statistically significant, t (23) = 1.62, p = .119, 95% CI [-0.1, 3.2], so we are not sufficiently confident that there is a positive effect in the population. We should note, however, that the sample is small (N = 25– this number is not included in the figure–), so test power is probably low, meaning that it is difficult to reject a false null hypothesis. On the basis of the confidence interval we conclude that the effect can be weak and negative, but the plausible effects are predominantly positive, including strong positive effects. One additional daily exposure may decrease predicted brand awareness by 0.1, but it may also increase brand awareness by up to 3.2 points on a scale from 1 (unaware of the brand) to 7 (highly aware of the brand). The latter effect is substantial: A single additional exposure to advertisements would lead to a substantial change in brand awareness. We should report that the population value seems to be larger (smaller) than specified in the null hypothesis but that we do not have sufficient confidence in this result because the test is not statistically significant. This is better than reporting that there is no difference because the statistical test is not significant. The fashion of speaking of a null hypothesis as “accepted when false”, whenever a test of significance gives us no strong reason for rejecting it, and when in fact it is in some way imperfect, shows real ignorance of the research workers’ attitude, by suggesting that in such a case he has come to an irreversible decision. The worker’s real attitude in such a case might be, according to the circumstances: “The possible deviation from truth of my working hypothesis, to examine which the test is appropriate, seems not to be of sufficient magnitude to warrant any immediate modification.” Or it might be: “The deviation is in the direction expected for certain influences which seemed to me not improbable, and to this extent my suspicion has been confirmed; but the body of data available so far is not by itself sufficient to demonstrate their reality.” (Ronald Aylmer Fisher, 1955: 73) Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher, Wikimedia Commons In a similar way, a very narrow confidence interval including the null hypothesis (e.g., Confidence Interval B in Figure 12.5.1) and a very narrow confidence interval near the null hypothesis but excluding it (e.g., Confidence Interval C in Figure 12.5.1) should not yield opposite conclusions because the statistical test is significant in the second but not in the first situation. After all, even for the significant situation, we know with high confidence (narrow confidence interval) that the population value is close to the hypothesized value. For example, we could interpret Confidence Interval C in Figure 4.20 in the following way: The effect of exposure to advertisements on brand awareness is statistically significant, t (273) = 3.67, p &lt; .001, 95% CI [0.1, 0.5]. On the basis of the confidence interval we are confident that the effect is positive but small (maximum b* = 0.05). One additional daily exposure increases predicted brand awareness by 0.1 to 0.5 on a scale from 1 (unaware of the brand) to 7 (highly aware of the brand). We need a lot of additional exposure to advertisements before brand awareness changes substantially. Using confidence intervals in this way, we avoid the problem that statistically non-significant effects are not published. Not publishing non-significant results, either because of self-selection by the researcher or selection by journal editors and reviewers, offers a misleading view of research results. If results are not published, they cannot be used to design new research projects. For example, effect sizes that are not statistically significant are just as helpful to determine test power and sample size as statistically significant effect sizes. An independent variable without statistically significant effect may have a significant effect in a new research project and should not be discarded if the potential effect size is so substantial that it is practically relevant. Moreover, combining results from several research projects helps making more precise estimates of population values, which brings us to meta-analysis.

According to the APA guidelines, we should report the test statistic, the associated degrees of freedom (if any), the value of the test statistic, the p value of the test statistic, and the confidence interval (if any). APA requires a particular format for presenting statistical results and it demands that the results are included at the end of a sentence. The statistical results for a t test on one mean, for example, would be: t (67) = 2.73, p = .004, 95% CI [4.13, 4.87] The degrees of freedom are between parentheses directly after the name of the test statistic. Chi-squared tests add sample size to the degrees of freedom, for instance: chi-squared (12, N = 89) = 23.14, p = .027. The value of the test statistic is 2.73 in this example. The p value is .004. Note that we report all results with two decimal places except probabilities, which are reported with three decimals. We are usually interested in small probabilities—less than .05—so we need the third decimal here. If SPSS rounds the p value to .000, report: p &lt; .001. Add (one-sided) after the p value if the test is one-sided. The 95% confidence interval is 4.13 to 4.87, so with 95% confidence we state that the population mean is between 4.13 and 4.87. Add (bootstrapped) after the confidence interval if the confidence interval is bootstrapped. Not all tests produce all results reported in the example above. For example, a z test does not have degrees of freedom and F or chi-squared tests do not have confidence intervals. Exact tests or bootstrap tests usually do not have a test statistic. Just report the items that your statistical software produces, and give them in the correct format. 4.4.2 Reporting to the general reader For fellow scientists and especially for the general reader, it is important to read an interpretation of the results that clarifies both the subject of the test and the test results. Make sure that you tell your reader who or what the test is about: What is the population that you investigate? What are the variables? What are the values of the relevant sample statistics? Which comparison(s) do you make? Are the results statistically significant and, if so, what are the estimates for the population? If the results are statistically significant, how large are the differences or associations? A test on one proportion, for example, the proportion of all households reached by a television station, could be reported as follows: “The television station reaches significantly and substantially (61%) more than half of all households in Greece in 2012, z = 4.01, p &lt; .001.” The interpretation of this test tells us the population (“all households in Greece”), the variable (“reaching a household”) and the sample statistic of interest (61%, indicating a proportion). It tells us that the result is statistically significant, which a fellow scientist can check with the reported p value. Note that the actual p value is well below .001. If we would round it to three decimals, it would become .000. This suggests that the probability is zero but there is always some probability of rejecting the null hypothesis if it is true. For this reason, APA wants us to report p &lt; .001 instead of p = .000. Finally, the interpretation tells us that the difference from .5 is substantial. Sometimes, we can express the difference in a number, which is called the effect size, and give a more precise interpretation (see Chapter 4.1.6 for more information).

Watch this micro lecture on test power for an overview of the chapter. Summary How large should my sample be? What does it mean if a statistical test is not significant? At the start of a quantitative research project, we are confronted with a seemingly simple practical question: How large should our sample be? In some cases, the statistical test that we plan to use gives us rules of thumb for the minimum size that we need for this test. This may tell us the minimum sample size but not necessarily the optimal sample size. Even if we can apply the statistical test technically, sample size may not be sufficient for the test to signal the population differences or associations, for short, the effect sizes, that we are interested in. If we want to know the minimum sample size that we need to signal important effects in our data, things become rather complicated. We have to decide on the size of effects that we deem important. We also have to decide on the minimum probability that the statistical test will actually reject the hypothesis of no effect (the nil) if the true effect in the population has the selected interesting size. This probability is the power of a test: the probability of rejecting a null hypothesis of no effect if the effect in the population is of a size interesting to us. If we do not reject a false null hypothesis, we make a Type II error. Thinking about sample size thus confronts us with a problem that we have hitherto neglected, namely the problem of not rejecting a false null hypothesis. This problem is very important if the null hypothesis represents our research hypothesis. If the null hypothesis represents our research hypothesis, our expectations are confirmed if we do not succeed in rejecting the null hypothesis. However, if we do not reject the null hypothesis, we cannot make a Type I error, namely rejecting a true null hypothesis. As a consequence, the significance level of our test, which is the maximum probability of making a Type I error, is meaningless. We must know the probability of rejecting a false null hypothesis—the power of the test—to express our confidence that our research hypothesis is true. This chapter reviews concepts that are central to understanding what statistical significance of a test means: sampling distribution, hypotheses, statistical significance, and Type I error. It adds concepts that we need to interpret a test that is not statistically significant: effect size, practical relevance, Type II error, and test power. "],["5.1-size-test-req.html", "5.1 Sample Size and Test Requirements", " 5.1 Sample Size and Test Requirements "],["5.2-effectsize.html", "5.2 Effect Size", " 5.2 Effect Size Figure 5.1: Sampling distribution of average candy weight under the null hypothesis that average candy weight is 2.8 grams in the population. We have learned that larger samples have smaller standard errors (Section 3.3.1). Smaller standard errors yield larger test statistic values and larger test statistics have smaller p values. In other words, a test on a larger sample is more often statistically significant. A larger sample offers more precision, so the difference between our sample outcome and the hypothesized value is more often sufficient to reject the null hypothesis. For example, we would reject the null hypothesis that average candy weight is 2.8 grams in the population if average weight in our sample bag is 2.70 grams and our sample is large. But we may not reject this null hypothesis if we have the same outcome in a small sample bag. The larger our sample, the more sensitive our test will be, so we will get statistically significant results more often. If we think of our statistical test as a security metal detector, a more sensitive detector will go off more often. Of course, the size of the difference between our sample outcome and the hypothesized population value matters as well. This difference is called observed effect size. If average candy weight in our sample bag deviates more from the average weight specified in the null hypothesis, we are more likely to reject the null hypothesis. In terms of a security metal detector: Our test will pick up large pieces of metal more easily than small pieces. Security metal detector. Jason Lander from Portland, United States, Wikimedia CommonsCC BY 2.0 The p value and rejection of the null hypothesis based on the p value, then, depend both on sample size and observed effect size. A larger sample size makes a statistical test more sensitive. The test will pick up (be statistically significant for) smaller effect sizes. A larger effect size is more easily picked up by a statistical test. Larger effect sizes yield statistically significant results more easily, so they require smaller samples. Deciding on our sample size, we should ask ourselves this question: What effect size should produce a significant test result? In the security metal detector example, at what minimum quantity of metal should the alert sound? To answer this question, we should consider the practical aims and context of our research. 5.2.1 Practical relevance Investigating the effects of a new medicine on a person’s health, we may require some minimum level of health improvement to make the new medicine worthwhile medically or economically. If a particular level of improvement is clinically important, it is practically relevant (sometimes called practically significant). If we have decided on a minimum level of improvement that is relevant to us, we want our test to be statistically significant if the average true health improvement in the population is at least of this size. We want to reject the null hypothesis of no improvement in this situation. For media interventions such as health, political, or advertisement campaigns, one could think of a minimum change of attitude affected by the campaign in relation to campaign costs. A choice between different campaigns could be based on their efficiency in terms of attitudinal change per cost unit. Note the important difference between practical relevance and statistical significance. Practical relevance is what we are interested in. If the new medicine is sufficiently effective, we want our statistical test to signal it. In the security metal detector example: If a person carries too much metal, we want the detector to pick it up. Statistical significance is just a tool that we use to signal practically relevant effects. Statistical significance is not meaningful in itself. For example, we do not want to have a security detector responding to a minimal quantity of metal in a person’s dental filling. Statistical significance is important only if it signals practical relevance. We will return to this topic in Chapter 6. 5.2.2 Unstandardized effect size 5.2.3 Standardized effect size and sample size We can use standardized effect size to express the effects that we are interested in. We choose whether small, moderate, or large effects are of practical interest to us. Preferably, we know from previous research whether small, moderate, or large effects are common in our type of research. If moderate or large effects are rare, we should use a sample size that allows detecting small effects. In contrast, when large effects occur frequently, we can do with a smaller sample that may overlook small effects. If we know the effect size in the sample for which we want statistically significant results, we can figure out the minimum sample size for which the test statistic is statistically significant. Figure 5.2: What is the minimum sample size required for a significant two-sided test result if the sample mean has a particular effect size? The p values belong to two-sided tests. Observed effect size as well as test statistics reflect the difference between what we expect according to the null hypothesis and what we observe in our sample. As a consequence, effect size indicators and test statistics are related. In some cases, such as Cohen’s d, the relation between effect size and test statistic is very simple. The test statistic t for a t test on one mean, for example, is equal to Cohen’s d times the square root of sample size. Here, the only difference between the two is sample size! Sample size influences the test statistic—the larger the sample, the larger the test statistic— but it does not influence effect size. This is an important difference. "],["5.3-hypothetical-world-versus-imaginary-true-world.html", "5.3 Hypothetical World Versus Imaginary True World", " 5.3 Hypothetical World Versus Imaginary True World In the preceding paragraphs, we determined sample size using the effect size that we expect to find in our sample. We should realize, however, that we are interested in the effect size in the population. The ‘true’ effect size, so to speak. The effect of a new medicine or media campaign in our sample is not important but the effect in the population is. This complicates the calculation of the sample size that we need. Instead of using the effect size in our (future!) sample, we must use the effect size in the population. 5.3.1 Imagining a population with a small effect Our null hypothesis states that average candy weight in the population is 2.8 grams. Let us decide that a small effect size is practically relevant. We can think now of a population that could be the true population if the effect size is small. For example, a population in which average candy weight is 2.9 grams (and the standard deviation is 0.5). We do not know whether average candy weight is 2.9 grams in the true population. So we may regard the statement that average candy weight is 2.9 grams in the population as another hypothesis. Let us call this the alternative hypothesis H1. Note that this is not an ordinary alternative hypothesis because it does not include all outcomes not covered by the null hypothesis (H0). Instead, it represents only one value, which is an important value to us because it represents a population with an interesting effect size. Figure 5.3 illustrates this situation. Before reading on, try to make sense of the steps in this figure. The questions accompanying the figure walk you through these steps. Figure 5.3: The relation between significance tests, effect size, Type II error, and power. 5.3.2 The world of the researcher We have two populations, a hypothetical population defined by our null hypothesis (H0) and an imaginary true population defined by the alternative hypothesis (H1). Once we have drawn our sample, we only deal with the hypothetical population as we have done in all preceding chapters. Acting as if the null hypothesis is true, we determine how (un)likely the sample is that we have drawn. If it is very unlikely, we have a p value below the significance level and we reject the null hypothesis. We say: If the null hypothesis is true, our sample is too unlikely, so we reject the null hypothesis. We can be wrong. Perhaps the null hypothesis is actually true and we were just very unfortunate to draw a sample that is very different from the population. If so, we make a Type I error (see Section 12.2.2). The probability that we will make this error is the significance level of the test, which is usually set to .05. This is what we are doing once we have the sample. Let us call this the world of the researcher. 5.3.3 The alternative world of a small effect Now let us ask ourselves: What is going to happen to our statistical test if the true population from which we draw our sample has average candy weight that is a bit higher (small effect) than candy weight according to our null hypothesis? If we actually sample from this imaginary true population, the sampling distribution centered around the alternative hypothesis (H1) in Figure 5.3 represents our true sampling distribution. It shows us the true probabilities (areas under the curve) of drawing a sample with a particular minimum or maximum value. These are the probabilities of our sample if there is a small effect in the population. Now that we know the true sampling distribution if there is a small true effect in the population, we can foresee what is going to happen when we enter the world of the researcher. The researcher is going to use the rejection region to decide on the null hypothesis. If the sample mean is in the rejection region, the researcher is going to reject the null hypothesis. Otherwise, the null hypothesis is not rejected. 5.3.4 Type II error If there is a (small) true effect in the population, the null hypothesis is not true. For example, average candy weight is not 2.8 grams, it is 2.9 grams in the population. If our sample mean is close to 2.8 grams, we may not reject the null hypothesis even if it is not true. This is a Type II error: not rejecting a false null hypothesis. The probability that we make a Type II error if there is a small effect is expressed by the yellow section in Figure 5.3, Steps 3 and 4. It is usually denoted by the Greek letter beta (\\(\\beta\\)). The yellow section represents the probability of drawing a sample from the population with a small effect size that is not in the rejection region, so the null hypothesis is not rejected. Table 5.1 summarizes the four possible situations that may arise if we test a null hypothesis. The null hypothesis may be true or false and we may or may not reject the null hypothesis. Table 5.1: Error types and their probabilities. Null is true Null is false Null is rejected Type I error, Significance level (alpha) No error, Power (1 - beta) Null is not rejected No error, (1 - alpha) Type II error, (beta) 5.3.5 Power of the test The probability of not making a Type II error is called the power of the test. It is equal to one minus the probability of making a Type II error, that is, 1 - \\(\\beta\\). The power of the test is represented by the green section in Figure 5.3, Step 4. It represents the probability of getting a sample that makes the researcher reject the null hypothesis. So a false null hypothesis is rejected and we do not make an error. In the example of Figure 5.3 Step 4, the power of the test is 84 per cent (0.84). If average candy weight is 2.9 grams in the population, we have 84 per cent probability of rejecting the null hypothesis that it is 2.8 grams if we draw a sample (of the current size) from this population. This is usually considered an acceptable level of power (see Section 5.4). Note that the power of a test is defined in relation to the true value in the population in, in this case an avarage candy weight of 2.9 grams, with a true effect size of (2.8 - 2.9) 0.1 gram. In research we often have no idea about the actual value in the population. We therefore often report the post hoc power and the observed effect size. 5.3.6 Post hoc power The post hoc power refers to probability of rejecting the null hypothesis assuming the alternative hypothesis has a population mean equal to the observed semple mean or more accurately the observed test statistic. Though an often used approach, it is obvious that multiple replications of a research study will yield different results. As the true population mean is not a random variable, the acutal power of a test should not vary. "],["5.4-sizeeffectpower.html", "5.4 Sample Size, Effect Size, and Power", " 5.4 Sample Size, Effect Size, and Power Finally, after all these sections, we can answer the question raised in the beginning of this chapter: How large should my sample be? To answer this question, we must consider effect size, type of test, significance level, and test power. Sample size, statistical significance, effect size, and test power are related. To determine the size of your sample, you have three sliders that you should adjust simultaneously. Statistical significance is the easiest slider to decide on; we usually leave the significance level at .05. We do not select a smaller value because it will reduce the power of the test (with the same sample size and effect size) as you may have noticed while answering Question 4. For effect size, we have to choose between a small, moderate, or large effect. Previous results of research similar to our research project can help us decide whether we should expect small effect sizes or not. If we have a concrete number for the (standardized) minimum effect size that is of practical relevance, we can use that number. For power, the conventional rule of thumb is that we like to have at least 80 per cent probability of rejecting a false null hypothesis. You may note that the probability of not rejecting a true null hypothesis is higher: 95 per cent. Remember, the probability to reject a true null hypothesis, which is the significance level, is usually set to five per cent, so the probability of not rejecting a true null hypothesis is 95 per cent. Power is set to a lower level because the null hypothesis is usually assumed to reflect our best knowledge about the world. From this perspective, we are keener on avoiding the error of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis (our current best knowledge) than falsely not rejecting (accepting) it. This approach, however, is not without criticisms as we will discuss in Chapter 6. Anyway, if you want to raise the power to the same level of .95, you can do so; it will require a larger sample. Unfortunately, test power receives little attention in several software packages for statistical analysis. Using power and effect size to calculate the required sample size is usually not provided in the package. To calculate sample size, we need dedicated software, for example GPower. 5.4.1 So how do we determine sample size? All in all, using effect size and test power to determine the size of the sample requires several decisions on the part of the researcher. Of course, it is important to ensure that our sample meets the requirements of the tests that we want to specify (Section 5.1). In practice, researchers often go well beyond this minimum. They try to collect as large a sample as is feasible just to be on the safe side. Does this mean that all we have learned about effect size and test power is useless? Certainly not. First of all, we should have learned that effect size is more important than statistical significance because effect size relates to practical relevance. Second, test power and Type II errors are important in situations in which we do not reject the null hypothesis. Then, we should calculate test power to get an impression of our confidence in the result. Is our test of sufficient power to yield significant results if there is an effect in the population? This is the topic of the next section. "],["5.5-research-hypothesis-as-null-hypothesis.html", "5.5 Research Hypothesis as Null Hypothesis", " 5.5 Research Hypothesis as Null Hypothesis As noted before (Section 12.3), the research hypothesis usually is the alternative hypothesis. We expect something to change, to be(come) different rather than be or stay the same. We expect an association to be present rather than absent. In this situation, rejection of the null hypothesis, which is the nil, supports our alternative hypothesis, hence our research hypothesis, so we are glad if we reject the null hypothesis. Of course, we know that we can be wrong. Our null hypothesis may still be true even if the probability of drawing a sample like the one we have drawn is so small that we have to reject the null hypothesis. This is a Type I error. Fortunately, we know the probability of making this error because it is the significance level that we have chosen, five per cent usually. We can live with this probability of making an error if we reject the null hypothesis. So we are doubly glad: We found support for our research hypothesis and we know how confident we are about this support. What if our research hypothesis is our null hypothesis? For example, we have a specific idea of average candy weight in the population from previous research or from specifications by the candy factory. Let us say that average candy weight is 2.8 grams according to the factory. If we want to test whether the candies have the specified average weight, our research hypothesis would specify this average weight: Do candies weigh on average 2.8 grams in the population? Specifying a particular value, the research hypothesis must be the null hypothesis (Section 12.2.1). In this example, H0: Average candy weight is 2.8 grams in the population. If the research hypothesis is the null hypothesis because it contains a single (two-sided) or boundary (one-sided) value for the population parameter, we find support for our research hypothesis if we do not reject the null hypothesis. We can be wrong in not rejecting the null hypothesis. If we do not reject a null hypothesis that is actually false, we make a Type II error. The significance level is irrelevant now because the significance level is the probability of making a Type I error. We do not reject the null hypothesis, so we can never reject a true null hypothesis (Type I error). Instead, the probability of making a Type II error is important, or rather, the probability of not making this error. This is the power of the test. So if our research hypothesis represents the null hypothesis and our research hypothesis is supported (not rejected), we need test power to know how confident we can be about the support that we have found. Here, test power is relevant, not statistical significance. "],["5.6-take-home-points-3.html", "5.6 Take-Home Points", " 5.6 Take-Home Points True effect size is the difference between the hypothesized value and the true (population) value. Observed effect size is the difference between the hypothesized value and the observed (sample) value. Effect size is related to practical relevance. Effect sizes are expressed by (standardized) mean differences, regression coefficients, and measures of association such as the correlation coefficient, R2, and eta2. Statistical significance of a test depends on the observed effect size and sample size. Because sample size affects statistical significance, it is wrong to use significance or a p value as an indication of effect size. If we do not reject a null hypothesis, this does not mean that the null hypothesis is true. We may make a Type II error: not rejecting a false null hypothesis. A researcher can make this error only if the null hypothesis is not rejected. The probability of making a Type II error is commonly denoted with the Greek letter beta (\\(\\beta\\)). The probability of not making a Type II error is the power of the test. The power of a test tells us the probability that we reject the null hypothesis if there is an effect of a particular size in the population. The larger this probability, the more confident we are that we do not overlook an effect when we do not reject the null hypothesis. A practical way to increase test power: Draw a larger sample.

Watch this micro lecture on criticisms of null hypothesis significance testing for an overview of the chapter. Summary How important is null hypothesis significance testing? In the preceding chapters, we learned to test null hypotheses. Null hypothesis significance testing is widely used in the social and behavioral sciences. There are, however, problems with null hypothesis significance tests that are increasingly being recognized. The statistical significance of a null hypothesis test depends strongly on the size of the sample (Chapters 4 and 4.1.6), so non-significance may merely mean that the sample is too small. In contrast, irrelevant tiny effects can be statistically significant in a very large sample. Finally, we normally test a null hypothesis that there is no effect whereas we have good reasons to believe that there is an effect in the population. What does a significant test result really tell us if we reject an unlikely null hypothesis? Among the alternatives to null hypothesis significance testing, using a confidence interval to estimate effects in the population is easiest to apply. It is closely related to null hypothesis testing, as we have seen in Section 12.5.1, but it offers us information with which we can draw a more nuanced conclusion about our results. "],["6.1-criticismsNHST.html", "6.1 Criticisms of Null Hypothesis Significance Testing", " 6.1 Criticisms of Null Hypothesis Significance Testing In null hypothesis significance testing, we totally rely on the test’s p value. If this value is below .05 or another significance level, we reject the null hypothesis and we do not reject it otherwise. Based on this decision, we draw a conclusion about the effect in the population. Is this a wise thing to do? Watch the video. Figure 6.1: The dance of the p values by Geoff Cumming. 6.1.1 Statistical significance is not a measure of effect size Perhaps, Chapter 4 on null hypothesis testing should have been titled Am I Lucky or Unlucky? instead of Am I Right or Am I Wrong? When our sample is small, say a few dozens of cases, the power to reject a null hypothesis is rather small, so it often happens that we retain the null hypothesis even if it is wrong. There is a lot of uncertainty about the population if our sample is small. So we must be lucky to draw a sample that is sufficiently at odds with the null hypothesis to reject it. If our sample is large or very large (a few thousand cases), small differences between what we expect according to our null hypothesis can be statistically significant even if the differences are too small to be of any practical value. A statistically significant result does not have to be practically relevant. In all, statistical significance does not tell us much about the effect in the population. Figure 6.2: Any effect can be statistically significant. It is a common mistake to think that statistical significance is a measure of the strength, importance, or practical relevance of an effect. In the video (Figure 6.1), this mistaken interpretation is expressed by the type of sound associated with a p value: the lower the p value of the test, the more joyous the sound. It is wrong to use statistical significance as a measure of strength or importance. In a large sample, even irrelevant results can be highly significant and in small samples, as demonstrated in the video, results can sometimes be highly significant and sometimes be insignificant. Never forget: A statistically significant result ONLY means that the null hypothesis must be rejected. If we want to say something about the magnitude of an effect in the population, we should use effect size. All we have is the effect size measured in our sample and a statistical test usually telling us whether or not we should reject the null hypothesis that there is no effect in the population. If the statistical test is significant, we conclude that an effect probably exists in the population. We may use the effect size in the sample as a point estimate of the population effect. This effect size should be at the core of our interpretation. Is it large (strong), small (weak), or perhaps tiny and practically irrelevant? If the statistical test is not significant, it is tempting to conclude that the null hypothesis is true, namely, that there is no effect in the population. If so, we do not have to interpret the effect that we find in our sample. But this is not right. Finding insufficient evidence for rejecting the null hypothesis does not prove that the null hypothesis is true. Even if the null hypothesis is false, we can draw a sample that does not reject the null hypothesis. In a two-sided significance test, the null hypothesis specifies one particular value for the sample outcome. If the outcome is continuous, for instance, a mean or regression coefficient, the null hypothesis can hardly ever be true, strictly speaking. The true population value is very likely not exactly the same as the hypothesized value. It may be only slightly different, but it is different. A statistically non-significant result does NOT mean that the null hypothesis is true. When we evaluate a p value, we had better take into account the probability that we reject the null hypothesis, which is test power. If test power is low, as it often is in social scientific research with small effect sizes and not very large samples, we should realize that there can be an interesting difference between true and hypothesized population values even if the test is not statistically significant. With low power, we have high probability of not rejecting a false null hypothesis (Type II error) even if the true population value is quite different from the hypothesized value. For example, a small sample of candies drawn from a population with average candy weight of 3.0 grams may not reject the null hypothesis that average candy weight is 2.8 grams in the population. The non-significant test result should not make us conclude that there is no interesting effect. The test may not pick up substantively interesting effects. In contrast, if our test has very high power, we should expect effects to be statistically significant, even tiny effects that are totally irrelevant from a substantive point of view. For example, an effect of exposure on attitude of 0.01 on a 10-point scale is likely to be statistically significant in a very large sample but it is probably substantively uninteresting. In a way, a statistically non-significant result is more interesting than a significant result in a test with high power. If it is easy to get significant results even for small effect sizes (high power), a non-significant result probably indicates that the true effect in the population is very small. In this situation, we are most confident that the effect is close to zero or absent in the population. As noted before (Section 5.3.4), standard statistical software usually does not report the power of a test. For this reason, it is not common practice to evaluate the statistical significance of results in combination with test power. By now, however, you understand that test power is affected by sample size. You should realize that null hypotheses are easily rejected in large samples but they are more difficult to reject in small samples. A significant test result in a small sample suggests a substantive effect in the population but not necessarily so in a large sample. A non-significant test result in a small sample does not mean that the effect size in the population is too small to be of interest. Don’t let your selection of interesting results be guided only by statistical significance. 6.1.2 Knocking down straw men (over and over again) There is another aspect in the practice of null hypothesis significance testing that is not very satisfactory. Remember that null hypothesis testing was presented as a means for the researcher to use previous knowledge as input to her research (Section 12.1). The development of science requires us to expand existing knowledge. Does this really happen in the practice of null hypothesis significance testing? Imagine that previous research has taught us that one additional unit of exposure to advertisements for a brand increases a person’s brand awareness on average by 0.1 unit if we use well-tested standard scales for exposure and brand awareness. If we want to use this knowledge in our own research, we would hypothesize that the regression coefficient of exposure is 0.1 in a regression model predicting brand awareness. Well, try to test this null hypothesis in your favourite statistics software. Can you actually tell the software that the null hypothesis for the regression coefficient is 0.1? Most likely you can’t because the software automatically tests the null hypothesis that the regression coefficient is zero in the population. This approach is so prevalent that null hypotheses equating the population value of interest to zero have received a special name: the nil hypothesis or the nil for short (see Section 12.3). How can we include previous knowledge in our test if the software always tests the nil? The null hypothesis that there is no association between the independent variable and the dependent variable in the population may be interesting to reject if you really have no clue about the association. But in the example above, previous knowledge makes us expect a positive association of a particular size. Here, it is not interesting to reject the null hypothesis of no association. The null hypothesis of no association is a straw man in this example. It is unlikely to stand the test and nobody should applaud if we knock it down. Rejecting an unlikely statement is called a strawman argument in rhetorics. Rejecting the nil time and again should make us wonder about scientific progress and our contribution to it. Are we knocking down straw men hypotheses over and over again? Is there no way to accumulate our efforts? "],["6.2-alternatives-for-null-hypothesis-significance-testing.html", "6.2 Alternatives for Null Hypothesis Significance Testing", " 6.2 Alternatives for Null Hypothesis Significance Testing In the social and behavioral sciences, null hypothesis testing is still the dominant type of statistical inference. For this reason, an introductory text like the current one must discuss null hypothesis significance testing. But it should discuss it thoroughly, so the problems and errors that occur with null hypothesis testing become clear and can be avoided. The problems with null hypothesis significance testing are increasingly being recognized. Alternatives to null hypothesis significance testing have been developed and are becoming more accepted within the field. In this section, some alternatives are briefly sketched. 6.2.1 Meta-analysis Meta-analysis is a method that capitalizes on previous knowledge. In this method, we collect previous studies on the same topic that use the same or highly similar variables. Combining the results of these studies, we can make statements with higher precision about the population. Basically, we combine the separate samples used for each single study into a large sample, which reduces the uncertainty and allows more precise inferences about the population. Meta-analysis is a good example of combining research efforts to increase our understanding. It favours estimation over hypothesis testing because the goal is to obtain more precise estimates of population values or effects. Meta-analysis is strongly recommended as a research strategy by Geoff Cumming, who coined the concept New Statistics. See Cumming’s book (2012), website, or YouTube channel if you are curious to learn more. The video at the start of Section 6.1 was made by Geoff Cumming. 6.2.2 Replication Another approach that builds upon previous results is replication. If we collect new data on variables that are central in prior research and we execute the same analyses, we replicate previous research. Replication is the surest tool to check results of previous research. Checks do not necessarily serve to expose fraud and mistakes. They tell us whether prior research results still hold at a later time and perhaps in another context. Thus, we can decrease the chance that our previous results derive from an atypical sample. But replication also helps us to develop more general theories and discard theories that apply only to special situations. 6.2.3 Bayesian inference A more radical way of including previous knowledge in statistical inference is Bayesian inference. Bayesian inference regards the sample that we draw as a means to update the knowledge that we already have or think we have on the population. Our previous knowledge is our starting point and we are not going to just discard our previous knowledge if a new sample points in a different direction, as we do when we reject a null hypothesis. Think of Bayesian inference as a process similar to predicting the weather. If I try to predict tomorrow’s weather, I am using all my weather experience to make a prediction. If my prediction turns out to be more or less correct, I don’t change the way I predict the weather. But if my prediction is patently wrong, I try to reconsider the way I predict the weather, for example, paying attention to new indicators of weather change. Bayesian inference uses a concept of probability that is fundamentally different from the type of inference presented in previous chapters, which is usually called frequentist inference. Bayesian inference does not assume that there is a true population value. Instead, it regards the population value as a random variable, that is, as something with a probability. Again, think of predicting the weather. I am not saying to myself: “Let us hypothesize that tomorrow will be a rainy day. If this is correct, what is the probability that the weather today looks like it does?” Instead, I think of the probability that it will rain tomorrow. Bayesian probabilities are much more in line with our everyday concept of probability than the dice-based probabilities of frequentist inference. Remember that we are not allowed to interpret the 95% confidence interval as a probability (Chapter 3)? We should never conclude that the parameter is between the upper and lower limits of our confidence interval with 95 per cent probability. This is because a parameter does not have a probability in frequentist inference. The credible interval (sometimes called posterior interval) is the Bayesian equivalent of the confidence interval. In Bayesian inference, a parameter has a probability, so we are allowed to say that the parameter lies within the credible interval with 95% probability. This interpretation is much more in line with our intuitive notion of probabilities. Bayesian inference is intuitively appealing but it has not yet spread widely in the social and behavioral sciences. Therefore, I merely mention this strand of statistical inference and I refrain from giving details. Its popularity, however, is increasing, so you may come in contact with Bayesian inference sooner or later. "],["6.3-no-random-sample.html", "6.3 What If I Do Not Have a Random Sample?", " 6.3 What If I Do Not Have a Random Sample? In our approach to statistical inference, we have always assumed that we have drawn a random sample. What if we do not have a random sample? Can we still estimate confidence intervals or test null hypotheses? If you carefully read reports of scientific research, you will encounter examples of statistical inference on non-random samples or data that are not samples at all but rather represent an entire population, for instance, all people visiting a particular web site. Here, statistical inference is clearly being applied to data that are not sampled at random from an observable population. The fact that it happens, however, is not a guarantee that it is right. We should note that statistical inference based on a random sample is the most convincing type of inference because we know the nature of the uncertainty in the data, namely chance variation introduced by random sampling. Think of exact methods for creating a sampling distribution. If we know the distribution of candy colours in the population of all candies, we can calculate the exact probability of drawing a sample bag with, for example, 25 per cent of all candies being yellow if we carefully draw the sample at random. We can calculate the probability because we understand the process of random sampling. For example, we know that each candy has the same probability to be included in the sample. The uncertainty or probabilities arise from the way we designed our data collection, namely as a random sample from a much larger population. In summary, we work with an observable population and we know how chance affects our sample if we draw a random sample. We do not have an observable population or we do not know the workings of chance if we want to apply statistical inference to data that are not collected as a random sample. In this situation, we have to substantiate the claim that our data set can be treated as a random sample. 6.3.1 Theoretical population Sometimes, we have data for a population instead of a sample. For example, we have data on all visitors of our website because our website logs visits. If we investigate all people visiting a particular website, what is the wider population? We may argue that this set of people is representative of a wider set of people visiting similar web sites or of the people visiting this website at different time points. This is called a theoretical population because we imagine such a population instead of actually sampling from an observable population. We have to motivate why we think that our data set (our website visitors) can be regarded as a random sample from the theoretical population. This can be difficult. Is it really just chance that some people visit our website whereas other people visit another (similar) website? Is it really just chance that some visit our website this week but not next week or the other way around? And how about people visiting our website both weeks? If it is plausible that our data set can be regarded as a random sample from a theoretical population, we may apply inferential statistics to our data set to generalize our results to the theoretical population. Of course, a theoretical population, which is imaginary, is less concrete than an observable population. The added value of statistical inference is more limited. 6.3.2 Data generating process An alternative approach disregards generalization to a population. Instead, it regards our observed data set as the result of a theoretical data generating process (for instance, see Frick, 1998; Hayes, 2013: 50-51). Think, for example, of an experiment where the experimental treatment is exposure to a celebrity endorsing a fundraising campaign. Exposure to the campaign triggers a process within the participants that results in a particular willingness to donate. Under similar circumstances and personal characteristics, this process yields the same outcomes, that is, generates the same data set. There is a complication. The circumstances and personal characteristics are very unlikely to be the same every time the process is at work (generates data). A person may pay more or less attention to the stimulus material, she may be more or less susceptible to this type of message, or in a better or worse mood for caring about other people, and so on. As a consequence, we have variation in the outcome scores for participants who are exposed to the same celebrity and who have the same scores on the personal characteristics that we measured. This variation is supposed to be random, that is, the result of chance. In this approach, then, random variation is not caused by random sampling but by fluctuations in the data generating process. Compare this to a machine producing candies. Fluctuations in the temperature and humidity within the factory, vibrations due to heavy trucks passing by, and irregularities in the base materials may affect the weight of individual candies. The weights are the data that we are going to analyze and the operation of the machine is the data generating process. We can use inferential techniques developed for random samples on data with random variation stemming from a data generation process if the probability distributions for sampling distributions apply to random variation in the data generating process. This is the tricky thing about the data generating process approach. It has been shown that means of random samples have a normal or t distributed sampling distribution (under particular conditions). The normal or t distribution is a correct choice for the sampling distribution here. In contrast, we have no correct criteria for choosing a probability distribution representing chance in the process of generating data that are not a random sample. We have to make up a story about how chance works and to what probability distribution this leads. In contrast to random sampling, this is a contestable choice. What arguments can a researcher use to justify the choice of a theoretical probability distribution for representing chance in the process of data generation? A bell-shaped probability model such as the normal or t distribution is a plausible candidate for capturing the effects of many independent causes on a numeric outcome (see Lyon, 2014 for a critical discussion). If we have many unrelated causes that affect the outcome, for instance, a person’s willingness to donate to a charity, particular combinations of causes will push some people to be more willing than the average and other people to be less willing. So we should give examples of unobserved independent causes that are likely to affect willingness to donate to justify a normal or t distribution. For example, mood differences between participants, fatigue, emotions, prior experiences with the charity, and so on. This is an example of an argument that can be made to justify the application of t tests in tests on means, correlations, or regression coefficients to data that is not collected as a random sample. The argument can be more or less convincing. The chosen probability distribution can be right or wrong and we will probably never know which of the two it is. The normal distribution is usually attributed to Carl Friedrich Gauss (1809). Pierre-Simon Laplace (1812), among others, proved the central limit theorem, which states that under certain conditions the means of a large number of independent random variables are approximately normally distributed. Based on this theorem, we expect that the overall (average) effect of a large number of independent causes (random variables) produces a variation that is normally distributed.

Wikimedia Commons "],["6.4-take-home-points-4.html", "6.4 Take-Home Points", " 6.4 Take-Home Points Null hypothesis significance test results should be interpreted in relation to sample size and, if possible, test power. Statistically significant results do not have to be relevant or important. A small, negligible difference between the sample outcome and the hypothesized population value can be statistically significant in a very large sample with high test power. A practically relevant and important difference between the sample outcome and the hypothesized population value does not have to be statistically significant in a small sample because of low test power. Give priority to effect size over statistical significance in your interpretation of results. A confidence interval shows us how close to and distant from the hypothesized value the plausible population values are. It helps us to draw a more nuanced conclusion about the result than a null hypothesis significance test. Applying statistical inference to data other than random samples requires justification of either a theoretical population or a data generating process with a particular probability distribution. "],["7-anova.html", "Chapter 7 Moderation with Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)", " Chapter 7 Moderation with Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) Key concepts: eta-squared, between-groups variance, within-groups variance, F test on analysis of variance model, pairwise comparisons, post-hoc tests, one-way analysis of variance, two-way analysis of variance, balanced design, main effects, moderation, interaction effect. Watch this micro lecture on moderation with analysis of variance for an overview of the chapter. Summary How do we test mean differences for three or more groups and what if group effects are not the same for all participants? Imagine an experiment in which participants watch a video promoting a charity. They see George Clooney, Angelina Jolie, or no celebrity endorse the charity’s fund-raiser. Afterwards, their willingness to donate to the charity is measured. Which campaign works best, that is, produces highest average willingness to donate? Or does one campaign work better for females, another for males? In this example, we want to compare the outcome scores (average willingness to donate) across more than two groups (participants who saw Clooney, Jolie, or no celebrity). To this end, we use analysis of variance. The null hypothesis tested in analysis of variance states that all groups have the same average outcome score in the population. This null hypothesis is similar to the one we test in an independent-samples t test for two groups. With three or more groups, we must use the variance of the group means (between-groups variance) to test the null hypothesis. If the between-groups variance is zero, all group means are equal. In addition to between-groups variance, we have to take into account the variance of outcome scores within groups (within-groups variance). Within-groups variance is related to the fact that we may obtain different group means even if we draw random samples from populations with the same means. The ratio of between-groups variance over within-groups variance gives us the F test statistic, which has an F distribution. Differences in average outcome scores for groups on one independent variable (usually called factor in analysis of variance) are called a main effect. A main effect represents an overall or average effect of a factor. If we have only one factor in our model, for instance, the endorser of the fund-raiser, we apply a one-way analysis of variance. With two factors, we have a two-way analysis of variance, and so on. With two or more factors, we can have interaction effects in addition to main effects. An interaction effect is the joint effect of two or more factors on the dependent variable. An interaction effect is best understood as different effects of one factor across different groups on another factor. For example, Clooney may increase willingness to donate among females but Jolie works best for males. The phenomenon that a variable can have different effects for different groups on another variable is called moderation. We usually think of one factor as the predictor (or independent variable) and the other factor as the moderator. The moderator (e.g., sex) changes the effect of the predictor (e.g., celebrity endorser) on the dependent variable (e.g., willingness to donate). Essential Analytics In SPSS, we use the One-Way ANOVA option in the Compare Means submenu for one-way analysis of variance and the Univariate option in the General Linear Model submenu for two-way analysis of variance. Figure 7.1: SPSS table of main and interaction effects in a two-way analysis of variance. The significance tests on the main effects and interaction effect are reported in the Tests of Between-Subjects Effects table. Figure 7.1 offers an example. The tests on the main effects are in the red box and the green box contains the test on the interaction effect. The APA-style summary of the main effect of endorser is: F (2, 137) = 8.43, p &lt; .001, eta2 = .10. Note the two degrees of freedom in between the brackets, which are marked by a blue ellipse in the figure. You get the effect size eta2 by dividing the sum of squares of an effect by the corrected total sum of squares (in purple ellipses in the figure): 37.456 / 389.566 = 0.10. Interpret the effects by comparing mean scores on the dependent variable among groups: If there are two groups on a factor, for example, females and males, compare the two group means: Which group scores higher? For example, females score on average 5.05 on willingness to donate whereas the average willingness is only 4.19 for males. The F test shows whether or not the difference between the two groups is statistically significant. If a factor has more than two groups, for example, Jolie, Clooney, and no celebrity endorser, use post-hoc comparisons with Bonferroni correction. The results tell you which group scores on average higher than another group and whether the difference is statistically significant if we correct for capitalization on chance. If you want to interpret an interaction effect, create means plots such as Figure 7.2. Compare the differences between means across groups. In the left panel, for example, we see that the effect of sex on willingness to donate (the difference between the mean score of females and the mean score of males) is larger for Clooney (pink box in the middle) than for no celebrity endorser (pink box on the left), and it is smallest for Angelina Jolie (pink box on the right). Similarly, we see that the effect of seeing Clooney instead of no celebrity endorser is larger for females (right-hand panel, pink box on the right) than for males (right-hand panel, pink box on the left). Figure 7.2: SPSS means plots of the interaction effect of sex and endorser on willingness to donate. Note that the pink boxes have been added manually to aid the interpretation. "],["7.1-different-means-for-three-or-more-groups.html", "7.1 Different Means for Three or More Groups", " 7.1 Different Means for Three or More Groups Celebrity endorsement theory states that celebrities who publicly state that they favour a product, candidate, or cause, help to persuade consumers to adopt or support the product, candidate, or cause (for a review, see Erdogan, 1999; for an alternative approach, see McCracken, 1989). Imagine that we want to test if the celebrity who endorses a fund raiser in a fund-raising campaign makes a difference to people’s willingness to donate. We will be using the celebrities George Clooney and Angelina Jolie, and we will compare campaigns with one of them to a campaign without celebrity endorsement. Figure 7.3: George Clooney and Angelina Jolie. Photo Clooney by Angela George CC BY-SA 3.0. Photo Jolie by Foreign and Commonwealth Office CC BY 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons. Let us design an experiment to investigate the effects of celebrity endorsement. We sample a number of people (participants), whom we assign randomly to one of three groups. We show a campaign video with George Clooney to one group, a video with Angelina Jolie to another group, and the third group—the control group—sees a campaign video without celebrity endorsement. So we have three experimental conditions (Clooney, Jolie, no endorser) as our independent variable. Our dependent variable is a numeric scale assessing the participant’s willingness to donate to the fund raiser on a scale from 1 (“absolutely certain that I will not donate”) to 10 (“absolutely certain that I will donate”). We will compare the average outcome scores among groups. If groups with Clooney or Jolie as endorser have systematically higher average willingness to donate than the group without celebrity endorsement, we conclude that celebrity endorsement has a positive effect. In statistical terminology, we have a categorical independent (or predictor) variable and a numerical dependent variable. In experiments, we usually have a very limited set of treatment levels, so our independent variable is categorical. For nuanced results, we usually want to have a numeric dependent variable. Analysis of variance was developed for this kind of data (R. A. Fisher, 1919), so it is widely used in the context of experiments. 7.1.1 Mean differences as effects Figure 7.4 shows the willingness to donate scores for twelve participants in our experiment. Four participants saw Clooney, four saw Jolie, and four did not see a celebrity endorser in the video that they watched. Figure 7.4: How do group means relate to effect size? A group’s average score on the dependent variable represents the group’s score level. The group averages in Figure 7.4 tell us for which celebrity the average willingness to donate is higher and for which situation it is lower. Random assignment of test participants to experimental groups (e.g., which video is shown) creates groups that are in principle equal on all imaginable characteristics except the experimental treatment(s) administered by the researcher. Participants who see Clooney should have more or less the same average age, knowledge, and so on as participants who see Jolie or no celebrity. After all, each experimental group is just a random sample of participants. If random assignment was done successfully, differences between group means can only be caused by the experimental treatment (we will discuss this in more detail in Chapter 10). Mean differences are said to represent the effect of experimental treatment in analysis of variance. Analysis of variance was developed for the analysis of randomized experiments, where effects can be interpreted as causal effects. Note, however, that analysis of variance can also be applied to non-experimental data. Although mean differences are still called effects in the latter type of analysis, these do not have to be causal effects. In analysis of variance, then, we are simply interested in differences between group means. The conclusion for a sample is easy: Which groups have higher average score on the dependent variable and for which are they lower? A means plot, such as Figure 7.5, aids interpretation and helps communicating results to the reader. On average, participants who saw Clooney or Jolie have higher willingness to donate than participants who did not see a celebrity endorser. Figure 7.5: A means plot showing that average willingness to donate is higher with a celebrity endorser than without a celebrity endorser. As a reading instruction, effects of endorsers are represented by arrows. Effect size in an analysis of variance refers to the overall differences between group means. We use eta2 as effect size, which gives the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (willingness to donate) explained or predicted by the group variable (experimental condition). This proportion is informative and precise. If you want to classify the effect size in more general terms, you should take the square root of eta2 to obtain eta. As a measure of association, eta can be interpreted with the following rules of thumb: 0.1 (0 ≤ eta2 &lt; .2) = small or weak effect, 0.3 (.2 ≤ eta2 &lt; .4) = medium-sized or moderate effect, 0.5 (.4 ≤ eta2) = large or strong effect. 7.1.2 Between-groups variance and within-groups variance For a better understanding of eta2 and the statistical test of an analysis of variance model, we have to compare the individual scores to the group averages and to the overall average. Figure 7.6 adds overall average willingness to donate to the plot (horizontal black line) with participants’ scores and average experimental group scores (coloured horizontal lines). Figure 7.6: Which part of score differences tells us about the differences between groups? Let us assume that we have measured willingness to donate for a sample of 12 participants in our study as depicted in Figure 7.6. Once we have our data, we first have a look at the percentage of variance that is explained, eta2. What does it mean if we say that a percentage of the variance is explained when we interpret eta2? The variance that we want to explain consists of the differences between the scores of the participants on the dependent variable and the overall or grand mean of all outcome scores. Remember that a variance measures deviations from the mean. The dotted black arrows in Figure 7.6 express the distances between outcome scores and the grand average. Squaring, summing, and averaging these distances over all observations gives us the total variance in outcome scores. The goal of our experiment is to explain why some of our participants have a willingness to donate that is far above the grand mean (horizontal black line in Figure 7.6) while others score a lot lower. We hypothesized that participants are influenced by the endorser they have seen. If an endorser has a positive effect, the average willingness should be higher for participants confronted with this endorser. If we know the group to which a participant belongs—which celebrity she saw endorsing the fundraising campaign—we can use the average outcome score for the group as the predicted outcome for each group member—her willingness to donate due to the endorser she saw. The predicted group scores are represented by the coloured horizontal lines for group means in Figure 7.6. Now what part of the variance in outcome scores (dotted black arrows in Figure 7.6) is explained by the experimental treatment? If we use the experimental treatment as predictor of willingness to donate, we predict that a participant’s willingness equals her group average (horizontal coloured line) instead of the overall average (horizontal black line), which we use if we do not take into account the participant’s experimental treatment. So the difference between the overall average and the group average is what we predict and explain by the experimental treatment. This difference is represented by the solid black arrows in Figure 7.6. The variance of the predicted scores is obtained if we average the squared sizes of the solid black arrows for all participants. This variance is called the between-groups variance. Playing with the group means in Figure 7.6, you may have noticed that eta2 is high if there are large differences between group means. In this situation we have high between-groups variance—large black arrows—so we can predict a lot of the variation in outcome scores between participants. In contrast, small differences between group averages allow us to predict only a small part of the variation in outcome scores. If all group means are equal, we can predict none of the variation in outcome scores because the between-groups variance is zero. As we will see in Section 7.1.3, zero between-groups variance is central to the null hypothesis in analysis of variance. The experimental treatment predicts that a participant’s willingness equals the average willingness of the participant’s group. It cannot predict or explain that a participant’s willingness score is slightly different from her group mean (the red double-sided arrows in Figure 7.6). Within-groups variance in outcome scores is what we cannot predict with our experimental treatment; it is prediction error. In some SPSS output, it is therefore labeled as “Error”. 7.1.3 F test on the model Average group scores tell us whether the experimental treatment has effects within the sample (Section 7.1.1). If the group who saw Angelina Jolie as endorser has higher average willingness to donate than the group who did not see an endorser, we conclude that Angelina Jolie makes a difference in the sample. But how about the population? If we want to test whether the difference that we find in the sample also applies to the population, we use the null hypothesis that all average outcome scores are equal in the population from which the samples were drawn. In our example, the null hypothesis states that people in the population who would see George Clooney as endorser are on average just as willing to donate as people who would see Angelina Jolie or who would not see a celebrity endorser at all. We use the variance in group means as the number that expresses the differences between group means. If all groups have the same average outcome score, the between-groups variance is zero. The larger the differences, the larger the between-groups variance (see Section 7.1.2). We cannot just use the between-groups variance as the test statistic because we have to take into account chance differences between sample means. Even if we draw different samples from the same population, the sample means will be different because we draw samples at random. These sample mean differences are due to chance, they do not reflect true differences between groups in the population. We have to correct for chance differences and this is done by taking the ratio of between-groups variance over within-groups variance. This ratio gives us the relative size of observed differences between group means over group mean differences that we expect by chance. Our test statistic, then, is the ratio of two variances: between-groups variance and within-groups variance. The F distribution approximates the sampling distribution of the ratio of two variances, so we can use this probability distribution to test the significance of the group mean differences we observe in our sample. Long story short: We test the null hypothesis that all groups have the same population means in an analysis of variance. But behind the scenes, we actually test between-groups variance against within-groups variance. That is why it is called analysis of variance. 7.1.4 Assumptions for the F test in analysis of variance There are two important assumptions that we must make if we use the F distribution in analysis of variance: (1) independent samples and (2) homogeneous population variances. 7.1.4.1 Independent samples The first assumption is that the groups can be regarded as independent samples. As in an independent-samples t test, it must be possible in principle to draw a separate sample for each group in the analysis. Because this is a matter of principle instead of how we actually draw the sample, we have to argue that the assumption is reasonable. We cannot check the assumption against the data. Here is an example of an argument that we can make. In an experiment, we usually draw one sample of participants and, as a next step, we assign participants randomly to one of the experimental conditions. We could have easily drawn a separate sample for each experimental group. For example, we first draw a participant for the first condition: seeing George Clooney endorsing the fundraising campaign. Next, we draw a participant for the second condition, e.g., Angelina Jolie. The two draws are independent: whomever we have drawn for the Clooney condition is irrelevant to whom we draw for the Jolie condition. Therefore, draws are independent and the samples can be regarded as independent. Situations where samples cannot be regarded as independent are the same as in the case of dependent/paired-samples t tests (see Section 2.3.6). For example, samples of first and second observations in a repeated measurement design should not be regarded as independent samples. Some analysis of variance models can handle repeated measurements but we do not discuss them here. 7.1.4.2 Homogeneous population variances The F test on the null hypothesis of no effect (the nil) in analysis of variance assumes that the groups are drawn from the same population. This implies that they have the same average score on the dependent variable in the population as well as the same variance of outcome scores. The null hypothesis tests the equality of population means but we must assume that the groups have equal dependent variable variances in the population. We can use a statistical test to decide whether or not the population variances are equal (homogeneous). This is Levene’s F test, which is also used in combination with independent samples t tests. The test’s null hypothesis is that the population variances of the groups are equal. If we do not reject the null hypothesis, we decide that the assumption of equal population variances is plausible. The assumption of equal population variances is less important if group samples are more or less of equal size (a balanced design, see Section 7.3.2). We use a rule of thumb that groups are of equal size if the size of the largest group is less than 10% (of the largest group) larger than the size of the smallest group. If this is the case, we do not care about the assumption of homogeneous population variances. 7.1.5 Which groups have different average scores? Analysis of variance tests the null hypothesis of equal population means but it does not yield confidence intervals for group means. It does not always tell us which groups score significantly higher or lower. Figure 7.7: Which groups have different average outcome scores in the population? The p values belong to independent-samples t tests on the means of two groups. If the F test is statistically significant, we reject the null hypothesis that all groups have the same population mean on the dependent variable. In our current example, we reject the null hypothesis that average willingness to donate is equal for people who saw George Clooney, Angelina Jolie, or no endorser for the fund raiser. In other words, we reject the null hypothesis that the endorser does not matter to willingness to donate. 7.1.5.1 Pairwise comparisons as post-hoc tests With a statistically significant F test for the analysis of variance model, several questions remain to be answered. Does an endorser increase or decrease the willingness to donate? Are both endorsers equally effective? The F test does not provide answers to these questions. We have to compare groups one by one to see which condition (endorser) is associated with a higher level of willingness to donate. In a pairwise comparison, we have two groups, for instance, participants confronted with George Clooney and participants who did not see a celebrity endorse the fund raiser. We want to compare the two groups on a numeric dependent variable, namely their willingness to donate. An independent-samples t test is appropriate here. With three groups, we can make three pairs: Clooney versus Jolie, Clooney versus nobody, and Jolie versus nobody. We have to execute three t tests on the same data. We already know that there are most likely differences in average scores, so the t tests are executed after the fact, in Latin post hoc. Hence the name post-hoc tests. Applying more than one test to the same data increases the probability of finding at least one statistically significant difference even if there are no differences at all in the population. Section 12.8 discussed this phenomenon as capitalization on chance and it offered a way to correct for this problem, namely Bonferroni correction. We ought to apply this correction to the independent-samples t tests that we execute if the analysis of variance F test is statistically significant. The Bonferroni correction divides the significance level by the number of tests that we do. In our example, we do three t tests on pairs of groups, so we divide the significance level of five per cent by three. The resulting significance level for each t test is .0167. If a t test’s p value is below .0167, we reject the null hypothesis, but we do not reject it otherwise. 7.1.5.2 Two steps in analysis of variance Analysis of variance, then, consists of two steps. In the first step, we test the general null hypothesis that all groups have equal average scores on the dependent variable in the population. If we cannot reject this null hypothesis, we have too little evidence to conclude that there are differences between the groups. Our analysis of variance stops here, although it is recommended to report the confidence intervals of the group means to inform the reader. Perhaps our sample was just too small to reject the null hypothesis. If the F test is statistically significant, we proceed to the second step. Here, we apply independent-samples t tests with Bonferroni correction to each pair of groups to see which groups have significantly different means. In our example, we would compare the Clooney and Jolie groups to the group without celebrity endorser to see if celebrity endorsement increases willingness to donate to the fund raiser, and, if so, how much. In addition, we would compare the Clooney and Jolie groups to see if one celebrity is more effective than the other. 7.1.5.3 Contradictory results It may happen that the F test on the model is statistically significant but none of the post-hoc tests is statistically significant. This mainly happens when the p value of the F test is near .05. Perhaps the correction for capitalization on chance is too strong; this is known to be the case with the Bonferroni correction. Alternatively, the sample can be too small for the post-hoc test. Note that we have fewer observations in a post-hoc test than in the F test because we only look at two of the groups. This situation illustrates the limitations of null hypothesis significance tests (Chapter 6). Remember that the 5 per cent significance level remains an arbitrary boundary and statistical significance depends a lot on sample size. So do not panic if the F and t tests have contradictory results. A statistically significant F test tells us that we may be quite confident that at least two group means are different in the population. If none of the post-hoc t tests is statistically significant, we should note that it is difficult to pinpoint the differences. Nevertheless, we should report the sample means of the groups (and their standard deviations) as well as the confidence intervals of their differences as reported in the post-hoc test. The two groups that have most different sample means are most likely to have different population means.

"],["7.3-different-means-for-two-factors.html", "7.3 Different Means for Two Factors", " 7.3 Different Means for Two Factors The participants in the experiment do not only differ because they see different endorsers in the charity video. In addition, there are differences according to sex: female versus male participants. Does participant’s sex matter to the effect of the endorser on willingness to donate? Figure 7.9: How do group means inform us about (main) effects in analysis of variance? In the preceding section, we have looked at the effect of a single factor on willingness to donate, namely, the endorser to whom participants are exposed. Thus, we take into account two variables: one independent variable and one dependent variable. This is an example of bivariate analysis. Usually, however, we expect an outcome to depend on more than one variable. Willingness to donate does not depend only on the celebrity endorsing a fundraising campaign. It is easy to think of more factors, such as a person’s available budget, her personal level of altruism, and so on. It is straightforward to include more factors in an analysis of variance. These can be additional experimental treatments in the context of an experiment as well as participant characteristics that are not manipulated by the researcher. For example, we may hypothesize that females are generally more charitable than males. 7.3.1 Two-way analysis of variance If we use one factor, the analysis is called one-way analysis of variance. With two factors, it is called two-way analysis of variance, and with three factors… well, you probably already guessed that name. A two-way analysis of variance using a factor with three levels, for instance, exposure to three different endorsers, and a second factor with two levels, for example, female versus male, is called a 3x2 (say: three by two) factorial design. 7.3.2 Balanced design In analysis of variance with two or more factors, it is quite nice if the factors are statistically independent from one another. In other words, it is nice if the scores on one factor are not associated with scores on another factor. This is called a balanced design. In an experiment, we can ensure that factors are independent if we have the same number of participants in each combination of levels on all factors. In other words, a factorial design is balanced if we have the same number of observations in each subgroup. A subgroup contains the participants that have the same level on both factors just like a cell in a contingency table. Table 7.1: Number of observations per subgroup in a balanced 3x2 factorial design. Female Male Clooney 2 2 Jolie 2 2 No endorser 2 2 Table 7.1 shows an example of a balanced 3x2 factorial design. Each subgroup (cell) contains two participants (cases). Equal distributions of frequencies across columns or across rows indicate statistical independence. In the example, the distributions are the same across columns (and rows), so the factors are statistically independent. In practice, it may not always be possible to have exactly the same number of observations for each subgroup. A participant may drop out from the experiment, a measurement may go wrong, and so on. If the numbers of observations are more or less the same for all subgroups, the factors are nearly independent, which is okay. We can use the same rule of thumb for a balanced design as for the conditions of an F test in analysis of variance: If the size of the smallest subgroup is less than ten per cent smaller than the size of the largest group, we call a factorial design balanced. A balanced design is nice but not necessary. Unbalanced designs can be analyzed but estimation is more complicated (a problem for the computer, not for us) and the assumption of equal population variances for all groups (Levene’s F test) is more important (a problem for us, not for the computer) because we do not have equal group sizes. Note that the requirement of equal group sizes applies to the subgroups in a two-way analysis of variance. With a balanced design, we ensure that we have the same number of observations in all subgroups, so we are on the safe side. 7.3.3 Main effects in two-way analysis of variance A two-way analysis of variance tests the effects of both factors on the dependent variable in one go. It tests the null hypothesis that participants exposed to Clooney have the same average willingness to donate in the population as participants exposed to Jolie or those who are not exposed to an endorser. At the same time, it tests the null hypothesis that females and males have the same average willingness to donate in the population. Figure 7.10: Means plots for the main effects of endorser and sex on willingness to donate. As a reading instruction, effects of endorsers and of being female are represented by arrows. The tested effects are main effects because they represent the effect of one factor. They express an overall or average difference between the mean scores of the groups on the dependent variable. The main effect of the endorser factor shows the mean differences for endorser groups if we do not distinguish between females and males. Likewise, the main effect for sex shows the average difference in willingness to donate between females and males without taking into account the endorser to whom they were exposed. We could have used two separate one-way analyses of variance to test the same effects. Moreover, we could have tested the difference between females and males with an independent-samples t test. The results would have been the same (if the design is balanced.) But there is an important advantage to using a two-way analysis of variance, to which we turn in the next section. "],["7.4-moderationanova.html", "7.4 Moderation: Group-Level Differences that Depend on Context", " 7.4 Moderation: Group-Level Differences that Depend on Context In the preceding section, we have analyzed the effects both of endorser and sex on willingness to donate to a fund raiser. The two main effects isolate the influence of endorser on willingness from the effect of sex and the other way around. This assumes that endorser and sex have an effect on their own, a general effect. We should, however, wonder whether endorser always has the same effect. Even if there is a general effect of endorser on willingness to donate, is this effect the same for females and males? Note that one endorser is a male celebrity who is reputed to be quite attractive to women. The other endorser is a female celebrity with a similar reputation among men. In this situation, shouldn’t we expect that one endorser is more effective among female participants and the other among male participants? If the effect of a factor is different for different groups on another factor, the first factor’s effect is moderated by the second factor. The phenomenon that effects are moderated is called moderation. Both factors are independent variables. To distinguish between them, we will henceforth refer to them as the predictor and the moderator. With moderation, factors have a combined effect. The context (group score on one factor) affects the effect of the other factor on the dependent variable. The conceptual diagram for moderation expresses the effect of the moderator on the effect of the predictor as an arrow pointing at another arrow. Figure 7.11 shows the conceptual diagram for participant’s sex moderating the effect of endorsing celebrity on willingness to donate. Figure 7.11: Conceptual diagram of moderation. 7.4.1 Types of moderation Moderation as different effects for different groups is best interpreted using a cross-tabulation of group means, which is visualized as a means plot. In a group means table, the Totals row and column contain the means for each factor separately, for example the means for males and females (factor sex) or the means for the endorsers (factor endorser). These means represent the main effects. In contrast, the means in the cells of the table are the means of the subgroups, which represent moderation. Draw them in a means plot for easy interpretation. In a means plot, we use the groups of the predictor on the horizontal axis, for example, the three endorsers. The average score on the dependent variable is used as the vertical axis. Finally, we plot the average scores for every predictor-moderator group, for instance, an endorser-sex combination, and we link the means that belong to the same moderator group, for example, the means for females and the means for males (Figure 7.12). Figure 7.12: How can we recognize main effects and moderation in a means plot? Moderation happens a lot in communication science for the simple reason that the effects of messages are stronger for people who are more susceptible to the message. If you know more people who have adopted a new product or a healthy/risky lifestyle, you are more likely to be persuaded by media campaigns to also adopt that product or lifestyle. If you are more impressionable in general, media messages are more effective. 7.4.1.1 Effect strength moderation Moderation refers to contexts that strengthen or diminish the effect of, for instance, a media campaign. Let us refer to this type of moderation as effect strength moderation. In our current example, we would hypothesize that the effect of George Clooney as an endorser is stronger for female participants than for male participants. In analysis of variance, effects are differences between average outcome scores. The effect of Clooney on willingness to donate, for instance, is the difference between the average willingness score of participants exposed to Clooney and the average score of participants who were not exposed to a celebrity endorser. Different “Clooney effects” for female and male participants imply different differences! The difference in average willingness scores between females exposed to Clooney and females who are not exposed to an endorser is different from the difference in average scores for males. We have four subgroups with average willingness scores that we have to compare. We have six subgroups if we also include endorsement by Angelina Jolie. Figure 7.13: Moderation as a stronger effect within a particular context. A means plot is a very convenient tool to interpret different differences. Connect the means of the subgroups by lines that belong to the same group on the factor you use as moderator. Each line in the plot represents the effect differences within one moderator group. If a line goes up or down, predictor groups have different means, so the predictor has an effect within that moderator group. A flat (horizontal) line tells us that there is no effect at all within that moderator group The distances between the lines show the difference of the differences. If the lines for females and males are parallel, the difference between endorsers is the same for females and males. Then, the effects are the same and there is no moderation. In contrast, if the lines are not parallel but diverge or converge, the differences are different for females and males and there is moderation. A special case of effect strength moderation is the situation in which the effect is absent (zero) in one context and present in another context. A trivial example would be the effect of an anti-smoking campaign on smoking frequency. For smokers (one context), smoking frequency may go down with campaign exposure and the campaign may have an effect. For non-smokers (another context), smoking frequency cannot go down and the campaign cannot have this effect. Except for trivial cases such as the effect of anti-smoking campaigns on non-smokers, it does not make much sense to distinguish sharply between moderation in which the effect is strengthened and moderation in which the effect is present versus absent. In non-trivial cases, it is very rare that an effect is precisely zero. (See Holbert and Park (2019) for a different view on this matter.) 7.4.1.2 Effect direction moderation In the other type of moderation, the effect in one group is the opposite of the effect in another group. In figure 7.14, for example, Clooney increases the average willingness to donate among females in comparison to the group who did not see a celebrity endorser. In contrast, average willingness for male Clooney viewers is lower than the average for males without endorser. Let us call this effect direction moderation. Males reverse the Clooney effect that we find for females. Figure 7.14: Moderation as a positive effect in one context and a negative effect in another context. In an extreme situation, the effect in one group can compensate for the effect in another group if it is about as strong but of the opposite direction (Figure 7.15). Imagine that George Clooney convinces females to donate but discourages males to donate because his charms backfires on men (pure jealousy, perhaps.) Similarly, Angelina Jolie may have opposite effects on females and males. Figure 7.15: Moderation as opposite effects in different contexts. In this situation, the main effect of endorser on willingness to donate is around zero. If we average over females and males, we obtain the means represented by the three grey dots. There is no net difference between Clooney, Jolie, and the condition without an endorser. This does not mean that the endorser does not matter. On the contrary, the interaction effects tell us that the endorser is effective for one group but counterproductive for another group. The second part of the conclusion is just as important as the first part. The campaigner should avoid decreasing the willingness to donate among particular target groups. 7.4.2 Testing main and interaction effects The effect of a single factor is called a main effect, as we learned in Section 7.3.3. A main effect reflects the difference between means for groups within one factor. The main effect of sex, for instance, can be that females are on average more willing to donate than males. A two-way analysis of variance includes two main effects, one for each factor (see Section 7.3.1), for example a main effect of sex and a main effect of endorser. For moderation, however, we compare average scores of subgroups, that is, groups that combine a level on one factor with a level on another factor. In Figure 7.16, we compare average willingness to donate for combinations of endorser and participant’s sex. The effect of differences among subgroups on the dependent variable is called an interaction effect. Just like a main effect, an interaction effect is tested with an F test and its effect size is expressed by eta2. Figure 7.16: How can we recognize main effects and moderation in a means plot? Interpretation of moderation requires some training because we must look beyond main effects. The fact that females score on average higher than males is irrelevant to moderation but it does affect all subgroup mean scores. So the fact that the red line is above the blue line in Figure 7.16 is not relevant to moderation. Moderation concerns the differences between subgroups that remain if we remove the overall differences between groups, that is, the differences that are captured by the main effects. The remaining differences between subgroup average scores provide us with a between-groups variance. In addition, the variation of outcome scores within subgroups yields a within-groups variance. Note that within-groups variance is not visible in Figure 7.16 because the willingness scores of the individual participants are not shown. We can use the between-groups and within-groups variances to execute an F test just like the F test we use for main effects. The null hypothesis of the F test on an interaction effect states that the subgroups have the same population averages if we correct for the main effects. Our statistical software takes care of this correction if we include the main effects in the model, which we should always do. Alternatively, we can formulate the null hypothesis of the test on the interaction effect as equal effects of the predictor for all moderator groups in the population. In the current example, the null hypothesis could be that the effect of endorser is the same for both sexes in the population. Or, the other way around, that the effect of sex is the same for different endorser groups in the population. Null hypothesis of the test on the interaction effect: equal effects of the predictor for all moderator groups in the population. Moderation between three or more factors is possible. These are called higher-order interactions. It is wise to include all main effects and lower-order interactions if we test a higher-order interaction. As a result, our model becomes very complicated and hard to interpret. If a (first-order) interaction between two predictors must be interpreted as different differences, an interaction between three factors must be interpreted as different differences in differences. That’s difficult to imagine, so let us avoid them. 7.4.3 Assumptions for two-way analysis of variance The assumptions for two-way analysis of variance are the same as for one-way analysis of variance (Section 7.1.4). Just note that equal group sizes and equal population variances now apply to the subgroups formed by the combination of the two factors. "],["7.5-reporting-two-way-analysis-of-variance.html", "7.5 Reporting Two-Way Analysis of Variance", " 7.5 Reporting Two-Way Analysis of Variance The main purpose of reporting a two-way analysis of variance is to show the reader the differences between average group scores on the dependent variable between groups on the same factor (main effects) and different differences for groups on a second factor (interaction effect). A means plot is very suitable for this purpose. Conventionally, we place the predictor groups on the horizontal axis and we draw different lines for the moderator groups. But you can switch them if this produces a more appealing graph. Figure 7.17: An example of a means plot. For the statistically informed reader, you should include the following information somewhere in your report: That you used analysis of variance and the analysis of variance type (one-way or two-way). The test result for every effect, consisting of the test name (F), the degrees of freedom, and the significance (p value). APA prescribes the following format if you report the test result within your text: F (df1, df2) = F value, p = p value. Note that df1 is the degrees of freedom of the factor (between-groups) and df2 is the degrees of freedom of the error (within-groups). For each effect report eta-squared (eta2) and interpret it in terms of effect size. If you have to calculate eta-squared by hand, divide the between-groups sum of squares of an effect by the total sum of squares (SPSS: corrected total). If SPSS calculates eta-squared, also report the confidence interval for eta-squared. For each effect worth interpretation, clarify which group or subgroup scores higher. Report the group means and their standard deviations or the mean difference with its confidence interval and p value (from the post-hoc tests) here. Note that the SPSS menu only supplies post-hoc tests for main effects of factors with more than two levels (groups). Pay special attention to an interaction effect. Explain how an effect (differences between groups) of the predictor differs across groups on the moderator. This results in sentences containing three variables. For example: “Clooney as endorser increases willingness to donate more among women than among men.” Do you recognize the three variables (predictor, moderator, and dependent variable) here? As always, don’t forget to mention the units (cases) and the meaning of the variables (factors and outcome). They describe the topic of the analysis. Report it if the main assumption is violated, that is, if you have (sub)groups of unequal size and the test on homogeneous variances is statistically significant. Report Levene’s test just like you report the F test of a main effect (see above). If the assumption is violated, we still report and interpret the results of the analysis of variance but we warn that the results may not be trustworthy. A two-way analysis of variance may produce many numeric results to report. It is recommended to present them as a table (in the text or in an appendix). If you report the table, include the error, the sums of squares and mean squares in the same way that SPSS reports them. Table 7.2 presents an example.

"],["7.7-take-home-points-5.html", "7.7 Take-Home Points", " 7.7 Take-Home Points In analysis of variance, we test the null hypothesis that all groups have the same population means. Behind the scenes, we actually test the ratio of between-groups variance to within-groups variance. The overall differences in average outcome scores between groups on one factor (independent variable) are a main effect in an analysis of variance. The differences in average outcome scores between subgroups, that is, groups that combine a level on one factor (predictor) and a level on another factor (moderator), represent an interaction effect. Note that we are dealing with the differences between subgroup scores that remain after the main effects have been removed. Moderation is the phenomenon that an effect is different in different contexts. The effect can be stronger or it can have a different direction. In analysis of variance, interaction effects represent moderation. Eta-squared measures the size of a main or interaction effect in analysis of variance. It tells us the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is accounted for by the effect. A means plot is very helpful for interpreting and communicating results of an analysis of variance. The F tests in analysis of variance do not tell us which groups have different average scores on the dependent variable. To this end, we use independent-samples t tests as post-hoc tests with a (Bonferroni) correction for capitalization on chance. To apply analysis of variance, we need a numeric dependent variable that has equal population variance in each group of a factor or each subgroup in case of an interaction effect. However, equality of population variances is not important if all groups on a factor or all subgroups in an interaction are more or less of equal size (the largest count is at most 10% of the largest count larger than the smallest count.)

Watch this micro lecture on regression analysis with a categorical moderator for an overview of the chapter. Summary My dependent variable is numerical but at least one predictor is also numerical, so I cannot apply analysis of variance. How can I investigate moderation with regression analysis? The linear regression model is a powerful and very popular tool for predicting a numerical dependent variable from one or more independent variables. In this chapter, we use regression analysis to evaluate the effects of an anti-smoking campaign. We predict attitude towards smoking from exposure to the anti-smoking campaign (numerical), time spent with smokers (numerical), and the respondent’s smoking status (categorical). Regression coefficients, that is, the slopes of regression lines, are the effects in a regression model. They show the predicted difference in the dependent variable for a one unit difference in the independent variable (exposure, time spent with smokers) or the predicted mean difference for two categories (smokers versus non-smokers). But what if the predictive effect is not the same in all contexts? For example, exposure to an anti-smoking campaign may generally generate a more negative attitude towards smoking. The effect, however, is probably different for people who smoke than for people who do not smoke. In this case, the effect of campaign exposure on attitude towards smoking is moderated by context: Whether or not the person exposed to the campaign is a smoker. Different effect sizes for different contexts are different regression coefficients for different contexts. We need different regression lines for different groups of people. We can use an interaction variable as an independent variable in a regression model to accommodate for moderation as different effects. An interaction variable is just the product of the predictor variable and the moderator variable. As an independent variable in the model, the regression coefficient of an interaction variable (interaction effect for short) has a confidence interval and a p value. The confidence interval tells us the plausible values for the size of the interaction effect in the population. The p value tests the null hypothesis that there is no interaction effect at all in the population. To interpret the interaction effect, we must determine the size of the effect of the predictor on the dependent variable for each group of the moderator. For example, the effect of campaign exposure on smoking attitude for smokers and the effect for non-smokers. An interaction effect in a regression model closely resembles an interaction effect in analysis of variance. The effect of a single predictor that is involved in an interaction effect in a regression model, however, is not a main effect as in analysis of variance. It is a conditional effect, namely the effect for one particular value of the moderator, that is, the effect within one particular context. To understand this, we must pay close attention to the regression equation. Essential Analytics In SPSS, we use the Linear option in the Regression submenu for regression analysis. For a moderation model, we first use the Compute Variable option in the Transform menu to calculate an interaction variable: we multiply (using *) the predictor variable by the moderator variable. The interaction variable is included in the regression model as an independent variable, just like the predictor, moderator, and any other independent variables (covariates). A categorical predictor variable such as a participant’s residential area (urban, suburban, rural) is included in the regression model as dummy variables, which have the values 0 or 1, for example: dummy variables suburban and rural, each with values yes (1) and no (0). The category without dummy variable is the reference group. The regression coefficient of a dummy variable gives us the difference between the average score on the dependent variable of the group scoring 1 on the dummy variable and the reference group. In the example presented in Figure 8.1, the attitude towards smoking for participants living in a suburban environment (red box) is on average 0.33 more positive than among participants in an urban environment (the reference group). Figure 8.1: SPSS table of regression effects for a model in which the effect of exposure is moderated by participant’s smoking status (reference group: people who never smoked). The predictor variable Exposure is included in the interaction effect. As a consequence, the regression coefficient for this variable (green box in Figure 8.1) expresses the effect of exposure on attitude towards smoking for the reference group on the other variable included in the interaction effect, namely, people who never smoked. A one unit increase in exposure predicts a 0.20 more negative (-0.197) attitude towards smoking for people who never smoked. If we would like to know the effect of exposure on attitude towards smoking for former smokers, we must add the regression coefficient for the interaction of exposure with former smokers (blue box) to the regression coefficient of exposure (green box): A one unit increase in exposure predicts a 0.47 more negative (-0.465 = -0.197 + -0.268) attitude towards smoking for former smokers. An interaction effect such as -0.27 for Former smoker * exposure tells us the difference between the exposure effect for former smokers and the exposure effect for people who never smoked (reference group). A plot of the regression lines shows the different exposure effects (Figure 8.2). The red line (effect of exposure for former smokers) has a stronger downward tendency than the blue line (exposure effect for people who never smoked). Figure 8.2: Simple regression lines showing the effect of exposure on attitude towards smoking for former smokers and people who never smoked (in an urban environment). "],["8.1-regression-equation.html", "8.1 The Regression Equation", " 8.1 The Regression Equation In the social sciences, we usually expect that a particular outcome has several causes. Investigating the effects of an anti-smoking campaign, for instance, we would not assume that a person’s attitude towards smoking depends only on exposure to a particular anti-smoking campaign. It is easy to think of other and perhaps more influential causes such as personal smoking status, contact with people who do or do not smoke, susceptibility to addiction, and so on. Figure 8.3: A conceptual model with some hypothesized causes of attitude towards smoking. Figure 8.3 summarizes some hypothesized causes of the attitude towards smoking. Attitude towards smoking is measured as a scale, so it is a numerical variable. In linear regression, the dependent variable (\\(y\\)) must be numerical and in principle continuous. There are regression models for other types of dependent variables, for instance, logistic regression for a dichotomous (0/1) dependent variable and Poisson regression for a count dependent variable, but we will not discuss these models. A regression model translates this conceptual diagram into a statistical model. The statistical regression model is a mathematical function with the dependent variable (also known as the outcome variable, usually referred to with the letter \\(y\\)) as the sum of a constant, the effects (\\(b\\)) of independent variables or predictors (\\(x\\)), which are predictive effects, and an error term (\\(e\\)), which is also called the residuals, see Equation (8.1). \\[\\begin{equation} \\small y = constant + b_1*x_1 + b_2*x_2 + b_3*x_3 + e \\tag{8.1} \\normalsize \\end{equation}\\] If we want to predict the dependent variable (\\(y\\)), we ignore the error term (\\(e\\)) in the equation. The equation without the error term [Eq. (8.2)] represents the regression line that we visualize and interpret in the following subsections. We use the error term only when we discuss the assumptions for statistical inference on a regression model in Section 8.1.4. \\[\\begin{equation} \\small y = constant + b_1*x_1 + b_2*x_2 + b_3*x_3 \\tag{8.2} \\normalsize \\end{equation}\\] 8.1.1 A numerical predictor Let us first have a close look at a simple regression equation, that is, a regression equation with just one predictor (\\(x\\)). Let us try to predict attitude towards smoking from exposure to an anti-smoking campaign. Figure 8.4: Predicting attitude towards smoking from exposure to an anti-smoking campaign. The orange dot represents the predicted attitude for the selected value of exposure. Good understanding of the regression equation is necessary for understanding moderation in regression models. So let us have a close look at an example equation [Eq. (8.3)]. In this example, the dependent variable attitude towards smoking is predicted from a constant and one independent variable, namely exposure to an anti-smoking campaign. \\[\\begin{equation} \\small attitude = constant + b*exposure \\tag{8.3} \\normalsize \\end{equation}\\] The constant is the predicted attitude if a person scores zero on all independent variables. To see this, plug in (replace) zero for the predictor in the equation (Eq. (8.4)) and remember that zero times something yields zero. This reduces the equation to the constant. \\[\\begin{equation} \\small \\begin{split} attitude &amp;= constant + b*0 \\\\ attitude &amp;= constant + 0 \\\\ attitude &amp;= constant \\end{split} \\tag{8.4} \\normalsize \\end{equation}\\] For all persons scoring zero on exposure, the predicted attitude equals the value of the regression constant. This interpretation only makes sense if the predictor can be zero. If, for example, exposure had been measured on a scale ranging from one to seven, nobody can have zero exposure, so the constant has no straightforward meaning. The unstandardized regression coefficient \\(b\\) represents the predicted difference in the dependent variable for a difference of one unit in the independent variable. For example, plug in the values 1 and 0 for the exposure variable in the equation. If we take the difference of the two equations, we are left with \\(b\\). Other terms in the two equations cancel out. \\[\\begin{equation} \\small \\begin{split} attitude = constant + b*1 \\\\ \\underline{- \\mspace{20mu} attitude = constant + b*0} \\\\ attitude \\mspace{4mu} difference = b*1 - b*0 = b - 0 = b \\end{split} \\tag{8.5} \\normalsize \\end{equation}\\] The unstandardized regression coefficient \\(b\\) represents the predicted difference in the dependent variable for a difference of one unit in the independent variable. It is the slope of the regression line. Whether this predicted difference is small or large depends on the practical context. Is the predicted decrease in attitude towards smoking worth the effort of the campaign? In the example shown in Figure 8.4, one additional unit of exposure decreases the predicted attitude by 0.6. This seems to be quite a substantial change on a scale from -5 to 5. In the data, the smallest exposure score is (about) zero, predicting a positive attitude of 1.6. The largest observed exposure score is around eight, predicting a negative attitude of -3.2. If exposure causes the predicted differences in attitude, the campaign would have interesting effects. It may change a positive attitude into a rather strong negative attitude. If we want to apply a rule of thumb for the strength of the effect, we usually look at the standardized regression coefficient (\\(b^*\\) according to APA, Beta in SPSS output). See Section 4.1.10.2 for some rules of thumb for effect size interpretation. Note that the regression coefficient is calculated for predictor values that occur within the data set. For example, if the observed exposure scores are within the range zero to eight, these values are used to predict attitude towards smoking. We cannot see this in the regression equation, which allows us to plug in -10, 10, or 100 as exposure values. But the values for attitude that we predict from these exposure values are probably nonsensical (if possible at all: -10 exposure?) Our data do not tell us anything about the relation between exposure and anti-smoking attitude for predictor values outside the observed zero to eight range. We should not pretend to know the effects of exposure levels outside this range. It is good practice to check the actual range of predictor values. 8.1.2 Dichotomous predictors Instead of a numerical independent variable, we can use a dichotomy as an independent variable in a regression model. The dichotomy is preferably coded as 1 versus 0, for example, 1 for smokers and 0 for non-smokers among our respondents. Figure 8.5: What is the difference in attitude between non-smokers and smokers? The interpretation of the effect of a dichotomous independent variable in a regression model is quite different from the interpretation of a numerical independent variable’s effect. It does not make sense to interpret the unstandardized regression coefficient of, for example, smoking status as predicted difference in attitude for a difference of one ‘more’ smoking status. After all, the 0 and 1 scores do not mean that there is one unit ‘more’ smoking. Instead, the coefficient indicates that we are dealing with different groups: smokers versus non-smokers. If smoking status is coded as smoker (1) versus non-smoker (0), we effectively have two versions of the regression equation. The first equation (8.6) represents all smokers, so their smoking status score is 1. The smoking status of this group has a fixed contribution to the predicted average attitude, namely \\(b\\). \\[\\begin{equation} \\small \\begin{split} attitude &amp;= constant + b*status \\\\ attitude_{smokers} &amp;= constant + b*1 \\\\ attitude_{smokers} &amp;= constant + b \\end{split} \\tag{8.6} \\normalsize \\end{equation}\\] Regression equation (8.7) represents all non-smokers. Their smoking status score is 0, so the smoking status effect drops from the model. \\[\\begin{equation} \\small \\begin{split} attitude &amp;= constant + b*status \\\\ attitude_{non-smokers} &amp;= constant + b*0 \\\\ attitude_{non-smokers} &amp;= constant + 0 \\end{split} \\tag{8.7} \\normalsize \\end{equation}\\] If you compare the final equations for smokers [Eq. (8.6)] and non-smokers [Eq. (8.7)], the only difference is \\(b\\), which is present for smokers but absent for non-smokers. It is the difference between the average score on the dependent variable (attitude) for smokers and the average score for non-smokers. We are testing a mean difference. Actually, this is exactly the same as an independent-samples t test! The unstandardized regression coefficient for a dummy (0/1) variable represents the difference between the average outcome score of the group coded as ‘1’ and the average outcome score of the group coded as ‘0’. Imagine that \\(b\\) equals 1.6. This indicates that the average attitude towards smoking among smokers (coded ‘1’) is 1.6 units above the average attitude among non-smokers (coded ‘0’). Is this a small or large effect? In the case of a dichotomous independent variable, we should not use the standardized regression coefficient to evaluate effect size. The standardized coefficient depends on the distribution of 1s and 0s, that is, which part of the respondents are smokers. But this should be irrelevant to the size of the effect. Therefore, it is recommended to interpret only the unstandardized regression coefficient for a dichotomous independent variable. Interpret it as the difference in average scores for two groups. 8.1.3 A categorical independent variable and dummy variables How about a categorical variable containing three or more groups, for example, the distinction between respondents who smoke (smokers), stopped smoking (former smokers), and respondents who never smoked (non-smokers)? Can we include a categorical variable as an independent variable in a regression model? Yes, we can but we need a trick. Figure 8.6: What are the predictive effects of smoking status? In this example, smoking status is measured with three categories: (1) non-smokers, (2) former smokers, and (3) smokers. Let us use the term categorical variable only for variables containing three or more categories or groups. This makes it easy to distinguish them from dichotomous variables. This distinction is important because we can include a dichotomous variable straight away as a predictor in a regression model but we cannot do so for a variable with more than two categories. We can only include such a categorical independent variable if we change it into a set of dichotomies. We can create a new dichotomous variable for each group, indicating whether (score 1) or not (score 0) the respondent belongs to this group. In the example, we could create the variables neversmoked, smokesnomore, and smoking. Every respondent would score 1 on one of the three variables and 0 on the other two variables (Table 8.1). These variables are called dummy variables or indicator variables. Table 8.1: Dummy variables for a categorical independent variable: One dummy variable is superfluous. Original categorical variable: neversmoked smokesnomore smoking 1 - Non-smoker 1 0 0 2 - Former smoker 0 1 0 3 - Smoker 0 0 1 If we want to include a categorical independent variable in a regression model, we must use all dummy variables as independent variables except one. In the example, we must include two out of the three dummy variables. Equation (8.8) includes dummy variables for former smokers (\\(smokesnomore\\)) and smokers (\\(smoking\\)). Include dummy variables as independent variables for all except one categories of a categorical variable. The category without dummy variable is the reference group. \\[\\begin{equation} \\small \\begin{split} attitude &amp;= constant + b_1*smokesnomore + b_2*smoking \\end{split} \\tag{8.8} \\normalsize \\end{equation}\\] The two dummy variables give us three different regression equations: one for each smoking status category. Just plug in the correct 0 or 1 values for respondents with a particular smoking status. Let us first create the equation for non-smokers. To this end, we replace both \\(smokesnomore\\) and \\(smoking\\) by 0. As a result, both dummy variables drop from the equation [Eq. (8.9)], so the constant is the predicted attitude for non-smokers. The non-smokers are our reference group because they are not represented by a dummy variable in the equation. \\[\\begin{equation} \\small \\begin{split} attitude &amp;= constant + b_1*smokesnomore + b_2*smoking \\\\ attitude_{non-smokers} &amp;= constant + b_1*0 + b_2*0 \\\\ attitude_{non-smokers} &amp;= constant \\end{split} \\tag{8.9} \\normalsize \\end{equation}\\] For former smokers, we plug in 1 for \\(smokesnomore\\) and 0 for \\(smoking\\). The predicted attitude for former smokers equals the constant plus the unstandardized regression coefficient for the \\(smokesnomore\\) dummy variable (\\(b_1\\)), see Equation (8.10). Remember that the constant represents the non-smokers (reference group), so the unstandardized regression coefficient \\(b_1\\) for the \\(smokesnomore\\) dummy variable shows us the difference between former smokers and non-smokers: How much more positive or more negative the average attitude towards smoking is among former smokers than among non-smokers. \\[\\begin{equation} \\small \\begin{split} attitude &amp;= constant + b_1*smokesnomore + b_2*smoking \\\\ attitude_{former smokers} &amp;= constant + b_1*1 + b_2*0 \\\\ attitude_{former smokers} &amp;= constant + b_1 \\end{split} \\tag{8.10} \\normalsize \\end{equation}\\] Finally, for smokers, we plug in 0 for \\(smokesnomore\\) and 1 for \\(smoking\\) [Eq. (8.11)]. The predicted attitude for smokers equals the constant plus the unstandardized regression coefficient for the \\(smoking\\) dummy variable (\\(b_2\\)). This regression coefficient, then, represents the difference in average attitude between smokers and non-smokers (reference group). \\[\\begin{equation} \\small \\begin{split} attitude &amp;= constant + b_1*smokesnomore + b_2*smoking \\\\ attitude_{smokers} &amp;= constant + b_1*0 + b_2*1 \\\\ attitude_{smokers} &amp;= constant + b_2 \\end{split} \\tag{8.11} \\normalsize \\end{equation}\\] The interpretation of the effects (regression coefficients) for the included dummies is similar to the interpretation for a single dichotomous independent variable such as smoker versus non-smoker. It is the difference between the average score of the group coded 1 on the dummy variable and the average score of the reference group on the dependent variable. The reference group is the group scoring 0 on all dummy variables that represent the categorical independent variable. If we exclude the dummy variable for the respondents who never smoked, as in the above example, the regression weight of the dummy variable \\(smokesnomore\\) gives the average difference between former smokers and non-smokers. If the regression weight is negative, for instance -0.8, former smokers have on average a more negative attitude towards smoking than non-smokers. If the difference is positive, former smokers have on average a more positive attitude towards smoking. Which group should we use as reference category, that is, which group should not be represented by a dummy variable in the regression model? This is hard to say in general. If one group is of greatest interest to us, we could use this as the reference group, so all dummy variable effects express differences with this group. Alternatively, if we expect a particular ranking of the average scores, we may pick the group at the highest, lowest or middle rank as the reference group. If you can’t decide, run the regression model several times with a different reference group. Finally, note that we should not include all three dummy variables in the regression model [Eq. (8.8)]. We can already identify the non-smokers, because they score 0 on both the \\(smokesnomore\\) and \\(smoking\\) dummy variables. Adding the \\(neversmoked\\) dummy variable to the regression model is like including the same independent variable twice. How can the estimation process decide which of the two identical independent variable is responsible for the effect? It can’t decide, so the estimation process fails or it drops one of the dummy variables. If this happens, the independent variables are said to be perfectly multicollinear. 8.1.4 Sampling distributions and assumptions If we are working with a random sample or we have other reasons to believe that our data could have been different due to chance (Section 6.3), we should not just interpret the results for the data set that we collected. We should apply statistical inference—confidence intervals and significance tests—to our results. The confidence interval gives us bounds for plausible population values of the unstandardized regression coefficient. The p value is used to test the null hypothesis that the unstandardized regression coefficient is zero in the population. Each regression coefficient as well as the constant may vary from sample to sample drawn from the same population, so we should devise a sampling distribution for each of them. These sampling distributions happen to have a t distribution under particular assumptions. Chapters 3 and 4 have extensively discussed how confidence intervals and p values are constructed and how they must be interpreted. So we focus now on the assumptions under which the t distribution is a good approximation of the sampling distribution of a regression coefficient. 8.1.4.1 Independent observations The two most important assumptions require that the observations are independent and identically distributed. These requirements arise from probability theory. If they are violated, the statistical results should not be trusted. Each observation, for instance, a measurement on a respondent, must be independent of all other observations. A respondent’s dependent variable score is not allowed to depend on scores of other respondents. It is hardly possible to check that our observations are independent. We usually have to assume that this is the case. But there are situations in which we should not make this assumption. In time series data, for example, the daily amount of political news, we usually have trends, cyclic movements, or issues that affect the amount of news over a period of time. As a consequence, the amount and contents of political news on one day may depend on the amount and contents of political news on the preceding days. Clustered data should also not be considered as independent observations. Think, for instance, of student evaluations of statistics tutorials. Students in the same tutorial group are likely to give similar evaluations because they had the same tutor and because of group processes: Both enthusiasm and dissatisfaction can be contagious. 8.1.4.2 Identically distributed observations To check the assumption of identically distributed observations, we inspect the residuals. Remember, the residuals are represented by the error term (\\(e\\)) in the regression equation. They are the difference between the scores that we observe for our respondents and the scores that we predict for them with our regression model. Figure 8.7: What are the residuals and how are they distributed? If we sample from a population where attitude towards smoking depends on exposure, smoking status, and contact with smokers, we will be able to predict attitude from the independent variables in our sample. Our predictions will not be perfect, sometimes too high and sometimes too low. The differences between predicted and observed attitude scores are the residuals. If our sample is truly a random sample with independent and identically distributed observations, the sizes of our errors (residuals) should be normally distributed for each value of the dependent variable, that is, attitude in our example. The residuals should result from chance (see Section 6.3.2 for the relation between chance and a normal distribution). So for all possible values of the dependent variable, we must collect the residuals for the observations that have this score on the dependent variable. For example, we should select all respondents who score 4.5 on the attitude towards smoking scale. Then, we select the residuals for these respondents and see whether they are approximately normally distributed. Usually, we do not have more than one observation (if any) for a single dependent variable score, so we cannot apply this check. Instead, we use a simple and coarse approach: Are all residuals normally distributed? A histogram with an added normal curve (like the right-hand plot in Figure 8.7) helps us to evaluate the distribution of the residuals. If the curve more or less follows the histogram, we conclude that the assumption of identically distributed observations is plausible. If not, we conclude that the assumption is not plausible and we warn the reader that the results can be biased. 8.1.4.3 Linearity and prediction errors The other two assumptions that we use tell us about problems in our model rather than problems in our statistical inferences. Our regression model assumes a linear effect of the independent variables on the dependent variable (linearity) and it assumes that we can predict the dependent variable equally well or equally badly for all levels of the dependent variable (homoscedasticity, next section). The regression models that we estimate assume a linear model. This means that an additional unit of the independent variable always increases or decreases the predicted value by the same amount. If our regression coefficient for the effect of exposure on attitude is -0.25, an exposure score of one predicts a 0.25 more negative attitude towards smoking than zero exposure. Exposure score five predicts the same difference in comparison to score four as exposure score ten in comparison to exposure score nine, and so on. Because of the linearity assumption, we can draw a regression model as a straight line. Residuals of the regression model help us to see whether the assumption of a linear effect is plausible. Figure 8.8: How do residuals tell us whether the relation is linear? The relation between an independent and dependent variable, for example, exposure and attitude towards smoking, does not have to be linear. It can be curved or have some other fancy shape. Then, the linearity assumption is not met. A straight regression line does not nicely fit such data. We can see this in a graph showing the (standardized) residuals (vertical axis) against the (standardized) predicted values of the dependent variable (on the horizontal axis), as exemplified by the lower plot in Figure 8.8. Note that the residuals represent prediction errors. If our regression predictions are systematically too low at some levels of the dependent variable and too high at other levels, the residuals are not nicely distributed around zero for all predicted levels of the dependent variable. This is what you see if the association is curved or U-shaped. This indicates that our linear model does not fit the data. If it would fit, the average prediction error is zero for all predicted levels of the dependent variable. Graphically speaking, our linear model matches the data if positive prediction errors (residuals) are more or less balanced by negative prediction errors everywhere along the regression line. 8.1.4.4 Homoscedasticity and prediction errors The plot of residuals by predicted values of the dependent variable tells us more than whether a linear model fits the data. Figure 8.9: How do residuals tell us that we predict all values equally well? The other assumption states that we can predict the dependent variable equally well at all dependent variable levels. In other words, the prediction errors (residuals) are more or less the same at all levels of the dependent variable. This is called homoscedasticity. If we have large prediction errors at some levels of the dependent variable, we should also have large prediction errors at other levels. As a result, the vertical width of the residuals by predictions scatter plot should be more or less the same from left to right. The dots representing residuals resemble a more or less rectangular band. If the prediction errors are not more or less equal for all levels of the predicted scores, our model is better at predicting some values than other values. For example, low values can be predicted better than high values of the dependent variable. The dots representing residuals resemble a cone. This may signal, among other things, that we need to include moderation in the model.

"],["8.3-categoricalmoderator.html", "8.3 Different Lines for Different Groups", " 8.3 Different Lines for Different Groups What if the effect of campaign exposure on attitude towards smoking may be different in different contexts, e.g., for people who smoke themselves and people who do not smoke? Perhaps, the campaign is more effective among smokers than among non-smokers or the other way around. If so, the effect of campaign exposure is moderated by the smoking status of the participants. In a conceptual diagram (Figure 8.14), moderation is represented by an arrow pointing at another arrow. The moderator (smoking status) changes the relation between the predictor (campaign exposure) and the dependent variable (attitude towards smoking). Figure 8.14: Conceptual diagram of moderation. We used a similar diagram to express moderation in two-way analysis of variance (Section 7.4). But now at least one of our independent variables is numeric, for example, the number of times the respondent has been exposed to the campaign. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) investigates the effects of categorical variables on a numerical dependent variable. It cannot handle numerical independent variables. Although there are ways to include numerical independent variables in analysis of variance, for example, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), we use regression analysis if we have a numerical dependent variable and at least one numerical independent variable. Use regression analysis if you have a numerical dependent variable and at least one numerical independent variable. In the current section, we discuss regression models with a numerical predictor and a categorical moderator. The next chapter (Chapter 9) presents regression models in which both the predictor and the moderator are numerical. 8.3.1 A dichotomous moderator and numerical predictor Figure 8.15: Is the effect of exposure on attitude moderated by smoking status? In Section 8.1, we have analyzed the predictive effects of exposure to an anti-smoking campaign and smoking status on a person’s attitude towards smoking. We have found a negative effect for exposure and a positive effect for smoking. More exposure predicts a more negative attitude whereas smokers have on average a more positive attitude towards smoking than non-smokers. Our current question is: Does exposure to the campaign have the same effect for smokers and non-smokers? We want to compare an effect (exposure on attitude) for different contexts (smokers versus non-smokers), so our current question involves moderation. Is the effect of exposure on attitude moderated by smoking status? Our moderator (smoker vs. non-smoker) is a dichotomous variable but our predictor (exposure) is numerical, so we cannot use analysis of variance. Instead, we use regression analysis, which allows numerical predictors. In the context of a regression model, moderation means different slopes for different groups. The slope of the regression line is the regression coefficient, which expresses the effect of the predictor on the dependent variable. If we have different effects in different contexts (moderation), we must have different regression coefficients for different groups. 8.3.2 Interaction variable How do we obtain different regression coefficients and lines for smokers and non-smokers? The statistical trick is quite easy: Include an additional predictor in the model that is the product of the predictor (exposure) and the moderator (smoking status). This new predictor is the interaction variable. The regression coefficient of the interaction variable is called the interaction effect. Figure 8.16: How does an interaction variable create different regression lines for different groups? The interaction variable must be included together with the original predictor and moderator variables, see Equation (8.12). This is also visible in the statistical diagram (Figure 8.17) for moderation in a regression model. \\[\\begin{equation} \\small \\begin{split} attitude = &amp;\\ constant + b_1*exposure + b_2*smoker + b_3*exposure*smoker \\end{split} \\tag{8.12} \\normalsize \\end{equation}\\] Figure 8.17: Statistical diagram of moderation. The smoking status variable is coded 1 for smokers and 0 for non-smokers. For clarity, we name this variable smoker with score 1 for Yes and score 0 for No. We have two different regression equations, one for each group on the dichotomous predictor smoker. Just plug in the two possible values (1 and 0) for this variable. For non-smokers [Equation (8.13)], the interaction variable drops from the model because multiplying by zero yields zero. For non-smokers, our reference group, \\(b_1\\) represents the effect of exposure on attitude. It is called the simple slope of exposure for non-smokers. \\[\\begin{equation} \\small \\begin{split} attitude = &amp;\\ constant + b_1*exposure + b_2*smoker + b_3*exposure*smoker \\\\ attitude_{non-smokers} = &amp;\\ constant + b_1*exposure + b_2*0 + b_3*exposure*0 \\\\ attitude_{non-smokers} = &amp;\\ constant + b_1*exposure \\end{split} \\tag{8.13} \\normalsize \\end{equation}\\] In contrast, the interaction variable remains in the model for smokers [Equation (8.14)], who score 1 on smoking status. Note what happens with the coefficient of the exposure effect if we rearrange the terms a little: The exposure effect equals the effect for the reference group of non-smokers (\\(b_1\\)) plus the effect of the interaction variable (\\(b_3\\)). The simple slope for smokers, then, is (\\(b_1 + b_3\\)). \\[\\begin{equation} \\small \\begin{split} attitude = &amp;\\ constant + b_1*exposure + b_2*smoker + b_3*exposure*smoker \\\\ attitude_{smokers} = &amp;\\ constant + b_1*exposure + b_2*1 + b_3*exposure*1 \\\\ attitude_{smokers} = &amp;\\ constant + b_1*exposure + b_3*exposure + b_2 \\\\ attitude_{smokers} = &amp;\\ constant + (b_1 + b_3)*exposure + b_2 \\end{split} \\tag{8.14} \\normalsize \\end{equation}\\] The interaction variable changes the slope of the effect of exposure on attitude. More specifically, the regression coefficient of the interaction variable (\\(b_3\\)) shows the difference between the simple slope of the exposure effect for smokers (\\(b_1+b_3\\)) and the simple slope for non-smokers (\\(b_1\\)). Let us assume that the unstandardized regression coefficient of the interaction effect is -0.3. This means that the effect of exposure on attitude is more strongly negative (or less positive) for smokers than for non-smokers. One additional unit of exposure decreases the predicted attitude for smokers by 0.3 more than for non-smokers. 8.3.3 Conditional effects, not main effects It is very important to note that the effects of exposure and smoking status in a model with exposure by smoking status interaction are not main effects as in analysis of variance. As we have seen in the preceding section [Equation (8.13)], the regression coefficient \\(b_1\\) for exposure expresses the effect of exposure for non-smokers. It is a conditional effect, namely the effect for non-smokers only. Non-smokers are the reference group because they score zero on the moderator (smoker). This is quite different from a main effect in analysis of variance, which is an average effect over all groups. In a similar way, the regression coefficient \\(b_2\\) for smoking status expresses the effect for persons who score zero on the exposure predictor. Simply plug in the value 0 for exposure in the regression equation [Eq. (8.15)]. \\[\\begin{equation} \\small \\begin{split} attitude = &amp;\\ constant + b_1*exposure + b_2*smoker + b_3*exposure*smoker\\\\ attitude_{no-expo} = &amp;\\ constant + b_1*0 + b_2*smoker + b_3*0*smoker \\\\ attitude_{no-expo} = &amp;\\ constant + b_2*smoker \\end{split} \\tag{8.15} \\normalsize \\end{equation}\\] Smoking status is a dichotomy, so its regression coefficient (\\(b_2\\)) tells us the average difference in attitude between smokers and non-smokers. Due to the inclusion of the interaction variable, it now tells us the difference in average attitude between smokers and non-smokers who have zero exposure to the anti-smoking campaign. Note again that this is a conditional effect, not a main effect. 8.3.4 Interpretation and statistical inference Table 8.2: Predicting attitude towards smoking: regression analysis results. B Std.

Lower Bound Upper Bound (Constant) 0.900 0.357 2.521 0.014 0.190 1.610 Exposure -0.162 0.061 -0.410 -2.651 0.010 -0.284 -0.040 Status (smoker = 1, non-smoker = 0) 1.980 0.738 0.096 2.683 0.009 0.512 3.448 Exposure*Status (smoker) -0.327 0.142 -0.238 -2.311 0.023 -0.609 -0.045 In Table 8.2, the effect of exposure on attitude depends on the value of smoking status because the model includes an interaction effect of exposure with smoking status (red). Non-smokers are the reference group on the smoking status dummy variable because they are coded 0. Therefore, the regression coefficient for exposure (blue) gives us the effect of exposure on smoking attitude for non-smokers. If you want to check this, plug in 0 for the smoking status variable in the regression equation that we may construct from Table 8.2. \\[\\begin{equation} \\small \\begin{split} attitude = &amp;\\ \\color{#FDAE61}{constant} + \\color{#2B83BA}{b_1*exposure} + \\color{#ABDDA4}{b_2*status} + \\color{#D7191C}{b_3*exposure*status}\\\\ attitude_{non-smoker} = &amp;\\ \\color{#FDAE61}{0.900} + \\color{#2B83BA}{-0.162*exposure} + \\color{#ABDDA4}{1.980*0} + \\color{#D7191C}{-0.327*exposure*0}\\\\ attitude_{non-smoker} = &amp;\\ \\color{#FDAE61}{0.900} + \\color{#2B83BA}{-0.162*exposure} + \\color{#ABDDA4}{0} + \\color{#D7191C}{0}\\\\ attitude_{non-smoker} = &amp;\\ \\color{#FDAE61}{0.900} + \\color{#2B83BA}{-0.162*exposure} \\end{split} \\tag{8.16} \\normalsize \\end{equation}\\] Multiplying by zero yields zero, so for non-smokers, the resulting effect of exposure on attitude is -0.16. An additional unit of exposure predicts a smoking attitude among non-smokers that is 0.16 points more negative. More exposure to the campaign goes together with a more negative attitude towards smoking for non-smokers. The p value for this effect tests the null hypothesis that the effect is zero in the population. If the exposure effect is statistically significant, we reject this null hypothesis. Smokers are coded 1 on the (smoking) status variable and non-smokers are coded 0, so the regression coefficient for the interaction variable tells us that the slope of the exposure effect is 0.33 lower for smokers than for non-smokers. The estimated slope of the exposure effect is -0.16 for non-smokers. We can add the regression coefficient of the interaction variable to obtain the estimated slope for smokers, which is -0.49. If you want to check this, plug in 1 for the smoking status variable in the regression equation. Add the two effects of exposure in the equation to obtain the effect of exposure on attitude for smokers. \\[\\begin{equation} \\small \\begin{split} attitude = &amp;\\ \\color{#FDAE61}{constant} + \\color{#2B83BA}{b_1*exposure} + \\color{#ABDDA4}{b_2*status} + \\color{#D7191C}{b_3*exposure*status}\\\\ attitude_{smoker} = &amp;\\ \\color{#FDAE61}{0.900} + \\color{#2B83BA}{-0.162*exposure} + \\color{#ABDDA4}{1.980*1} + \\color{#D7191C}{-0.327*exposure*1}\\\\ attitude_{smoker} = &amp;\\ \\color{#FDAE61}{0.900} + \\color{#2B83BA}{-0.162*exposure} + \\color{#ABDDA4}{1.980} + \\color{#D7191C}{-0.327*exposure}\\\\ attitude_{smoker} = &amp;\\ \\color{#FDAE61}{0.900} + \\color{#2B83BA}{-0.162*exposure} + \\color{#D7191C}{-0.327*exposure} + \\color{#ABDDA4}{1.980}\\\\ attitude_{smoker} = &amp;\\ \\color{#FDAE61}{0.900} + (\\color{#2B83BA}{-0.162} + \\color{#D7191C}{-0.327})*exposure + \\color{#ABDDA4}{1.980}\\\\ attitude_{smoker} = &amp;\\ \\color{#FDAE61}{0.900} + -0.489*exposure + \\color{#ABDDA4}{1.980} \\end{split} \\tag{8.17} \\normalsize \\end{equation}\\] Now we can compare the slopes (regression coefficients) for the two groups, which gives good insight into the nature of moderation in this example. The effect of exposure on attitude is more strongly negative for smokers (-0.49) than for non-smokers (-0.16). The interaction variable is treated as an ordinary predictor in the estimation process, so it receives a confidence interval and a p value. The null hypothesis for the p value is that the interaction effect is zero in the population. In other words, the effect of exposure on attitude is hypothesized to be the same for smokers and non-smokers in the population; no moderation is expected in the population. We know the confidence intervals and p values of the exposure effect for non-smokers (the regression coefficient for exposure) and for the difference between their exposure effect and the exposure effect for smokers (the regression coefficient for the interaction effect). We do not know, however, the confidence interval and statistical significance of the exposure effect for smokers. We cannot add confidence intervals or p values, so we do not know if the effect of exposure for smokers is significantly different from zero in the population. If you want to know the confidence interval or p value of the exposure effect for smokers, you have to rerun the regression analysis using a different dummy variable for the moderator. You should create a dichotomous variable that assigns 0 to smokers and 1 to non-smokers, and an interaction variable created with this dichotomy. The regression coefficient of the exposure effect now expresses the effect for smokers because smokers are the reference group on the new dummy variable. The associated p value and confidence interval apply to the exposure effect for smokers. Interaction variables are used just like ordinary predictors, so the general assumptions of regression analysis apply. See Section 8.1.4 for a description of the assumptions and checks. In a similar way, the effect of smoking status on attitude is conditional on exposure because smoking status and exposure are included in the interaction variable. The regression coefficient for status tells us the difference between smokers and non-smokers who have 0 exposure. So, without exposure to the campaign, smokers are on average 1.98 more positive towards smoking than non-smokers. The p value tests the null hypothesis that the difference is zero for people without exposure (exposure = 0) to the anti-smoking campaign. Let us conclude the interpretation with a warning. The standardized regression coefficients that SPSS reports for interaction effects or effects of predictors that are involved in interaction effects must not be used. They are calculated in the wrong way if the regression model includes an interaction variable. As a result, they are misleading. 8.3.5 A categorical moderator What if we have three or more groups on our moderator? For example, smoking status measured with three categories: (1) never smoked, (2) formerly smoked, (3) currently smoking? Does the effect of exposure on attitude vary between non-smokers, participants who stopped smoking, and those who are still smoking? Figure 8.18: When do we have moderation with a categorical moderator? In Section 8.1.3, we learned that we must create dummy variables for all but one groups of a categorical predictor in a regression model. This is what we have to do also for a categorical moderator. If the effect of a predictor, such as exposure, is moderated by a categorical variable, we have to create an interaction variable for each dummy variable in the equation. To create the interaction variables, we multiply the predictor by each of the dummy variables. Figure 8.19: Statistical diagram with a moderator consisting of three groups. Non-smokers are the reference group In the end, we have an interaction variable for all groups but one on the categorical moderator. Figure 8.19 shows the statistical diagram. Estimation of the model yields point estimates (regression coefficients), confidence intervals, and p values for all independent variables (Table 8.3). Table 8.3: Predicting attitude towards smoking for three smoking status groups: regression analysis results. B Std. Error t Sig. Lower Bound Upper Bound (Constant) 1.644 0.288 5.717 0.000 1.072 2.216 Exposure -0.185 0.046 -3.987 0.000 -0.277 -0.093 Former smoker -1.095 0.544 -2.013 0.048 -2.178 -0.012 Smoker 1.235 0.521 2.372 0.020 0.199 2.272 Exposure*Former smoker -0.405 0.112 -3.604 0.001 -0.629 -0.181 Exposure*Smoker -0.304 0.098 -3.116 0.003 -0.498 -0.110 Remember that the effects of predictors that are included in interactions are conditional effects: effects for the reference group or reference value on the other variable involved in the interaction. Non-smokers are the reference group for participant’s smoking status. The p value for the exposure predictor tests the hypothesis that the exposure effect for non-smokers is zero in the population. For the two dummy variables Former smoker and Smoker, the null hypothesis is tested that they have the same average attitude in the population as the non-smokers (reference group) if they are not exposed to the anti-smoking campaign. Participants who are not exposed to the campaign (zero exposure) are the reference group here. Interaction predictors show effect differences. In Table 8.3, the interaction predictors test the null hypotheses that the effect of exposure on attitude is equal for former smokers and non-smokers (Exposure*Former smoker) or for smokers and non-smokers (Exposure*Smoker) in the population. If we would like to know whether the exposure effect for former smokers is significantly different from zero, we have to rerun the regression model using former smokers as reference group. This new model would also tell us whether the exposure effect for former smokers is significantly different from the exposure effect for people who are still smoking. 8.3.6 Common support In a regression model with moderation, we have to interpret the effect of a predictor involved in an interaction at a particular value of the moderator (Section 8.3.3). The estimated effect at a particular value of the moderator can only be trusted if there are quite some observations at or near this value of the moderator. In addition, these observations should cover the full range of values on the predictor. After all, the effect that we estimate must tell us whether high values on the predictor go together with higher (or lower) values on the dependent variable than low values on the predictor. For example, we need quite some observations for smokers to estimate the conditional effect of exposure on attitude for smokers. If there are hardly any smokers in our sample, we cannot estimate the effect of exposure on attitude for them in a reliable way. Even if we have quite some observations for smokers but all smokers have low exposure, we cannot say much about the effect of exposure on attitude for them. If we cannot say much about the effect within this group, we cannot say much about the difference between this effect and effects for other groups. In short, the moderation model is problematic in this situation. Figure 8.20: How well do the observations cover the predictor within each category of smoking status? The variation of predictor scores for a particular value of the moderator is called common support (Hainmueller, Mummolo, &amp; Xu, 2016). If common support for predictors involved in moderation is poor, we should hesitate to draw conclusions from the estimated effects. Guidelines for good common support are hard to give. Common support is usually acceptable if there are observations over the entire range of the predictor. It is recommended to check the number of observations per value of the moderator. For a categorical moderator, such as smoking status, a scatter plot of the dependent variable (vertical axis) by predictor (horizontal axis) with dots coloured according to the moderator category may do the job. The left panel of Figure 8.20 shows an example. Check that there are observations for more or less all values of the predictor in each color. If the scatter plot is hard to read, create a histogram of predictor values grouped by moderator categories, as in the right panel of Figure 8.20. 8.3.7 Visualizing moderation and covariates A plot with different regression lines for different categories of the moderator is a very useful way of presenting your results. We can, however, only plot a regression line if we have a single independent variable. After all, we only have one horizontal (X) axis in a plot to display a predictor. In a moderation model, we have at least two independent variables: the predictor and the moderator. For example, exposure is our predictor because our interest focuses on the effect of campaign exposure on attitude. Participant’s smoking status is the moderator because we expect different exposure effects for participants with different smoking statuses. We may even have additional independent variables for which we want to control (more on this in Chapter 10), for example, a participant’s contacts with smokers. Let us call these additional independent variables covariates. A predictor is the independent variable that is currently central to our analysis. A moderator is an independent variable for which we expect different effects of the predictor. A covariate is an independent variable that is currently not central to our analysis. Note that the distinction between predictor, moderator, and covariate is temporary. As soon as we focus on another variable, that variable becomes the predictor and the other predictors become moderators or covariates. The distinction between predictor, moderator, and covariate is just terminology to show on which variable we focus. Figure 8.21: Statistical diagram of moderation with contact as covariate. Figure 8.21 shows the statistical diagram of a moderation model with contact as covariate and Table 8.4 summarizes the estimated effects. How can we get rid of the moderator and covariate(s), so exposure is left as the only independent variable and we can plot regression lines for exposure effects? Table 8.4: Predicting attitude towards smoking: regression analysis results with contact as covariate. B Std. Error Beta t Sig. Lower Bound Upper Bound (Constant) -0.087 0.684 -0.127 0.899 -1.448 1.275 Exposure -0.118 0.066 -0.332 -1.786 0.078 -0.249 0.013 Smoker (0 = no, 1 = yes)) 1.982 0.730 0.095 2.717 0.008 0.530 3.434 Exposure*Smoker -0.329 0.140 -0.239 -2.348 0.021 -0.607 -0.050 Contact 0.152 0.090 0.180 1.683 0.096 -0.028 0.331 As a first step, use the estimated values of the regression coefficients in the SPSS output (Table 8.4) to create a regression equation [Eq. (8.18)]. Just start at the top of the table and write down the regression coefficients (B) and the independent variable names. \\[\\begin{equation} \\small \\begin{split} attitude = &amp;\\ \\color{#FDAE61}{-0.087} + \\color{#2B83BA}{-0.118*exposure} + \\color{#ABDDA4}{1.982*smoker} + \\color{#D7191C}{-0.329*exposure*smoker}\\\\ &amp;+ \\color{brown}{0.152*contact} \\end{split} \\tag{8.18} \\normalsize \\end{equation}\\] As a second step, choose an interesting value for every independent variable in the equation except the predictor. If we want to have the regression line for smokers, choose 1 for the smoker variable. For a numerical covariate such as contact, it is recommended to choose the mean. Average contact with smokers happens to be 5.091 in our example. Now replace the independent variables in the equation by the selected values and simplify the equation [Eq. (8.19)]. \\[\\begin{equation} \\small \\begin{split} attitude = &amp;\\ \\color{#FDAE61}{-0.087} + \\color{#2B83BA}{-0.118*exposure} + \\color{#ABDDA4}{1.982*smoker} + \\color{#D7191C}{-0.329*exposure*smoker}\\\\ &amp;+ \\color{brown}{0.152*contact}\\\\ attitude = &amp;\\ \\color{#FDAE61}{-0.087} + \\color{#2B83BA}{-0.118*exposure} + \\color{#ABDDA4}{1.982*1} + \\color{#D7191C}{-0.329*exposure*1} + \\color{brown}{0.152*5.091}\\\\ attitude = &amp;\\ \\color{#FDAE61}{-0.087} + \\color{#2B83BA}{-0.118*exposure} + \\color{#ABDDA4}{1.982} + \\color{#D7191C}{-0.329*exposure} + \\color{brown}{0.772}\\\\ attitude = &amp;\\ (\\color{#FDAE61}{-0.087} + \\color{#ABDDA4}{1.982}+ \\color{brown}{0.772}) + (\\color{#2B83BA}{-0.118*exposure} + \\color{#D7191C}{-0.329*exposure})\\\\ attitude = &amp;\\ 2.669 + -0.447*exposure \\end{split} \\tag{8.19} \\normalsize \\end{equation}\\] The terms with smoker and contact disappear from the equation, so exposure is the only independent variable that remains in the equation. Now, we can draw the simple regression line predicting attitude from exposure for smokers using this equation. Note that this is the regression line for people with average contact with smokers. Repeat these steps but plug in the score 0 for the smoker predictor to obtain the simple regression line for non-smokers. Figure 8.22 shows the two regression lines and their equations. The effect of exposure on attitude is more strongly negative for smokers than for non-smokers. Figure 8.22: The effects of exposure on attitude for non-smokers and smokers. Both smokers and non-smokers are assumed to have average contact with smokers.

We use dummy variables to include a categorical variable as a predictor in a regression model. We need a dummy (1/0) variable for each category on the categorical variable except for one category, which represents the reference group. We use an F test to test the null hypothesis that the regression model does not help to predict the dependent variable in the population. We use a t test to test the null hypothesis that a regression coefficient is zero in the population. In a regression model, moderation means that there are different slopes (effects of the predictor) for different groups or contexts (moderator). Interaction variables represent moderation in a regression model. An interaction variable is the product of the predictor and moderator. If a categorical moderator is represented by one or more dummy variables, we need an interaction variable for each of the moderator’s dummy variables. Statistical inference for an interaction variable is exactly the same as for “ordinary” regression predictors. The effect of the predictor in a model with an interaction variable does not represent a main or average effect. It is a conditional effect: The effect for cases that score zero on the moderator. To interpret moderation, describe the effects (slopes, unstandardized regression coefficients) and visualize the regression lines for different groups. Warn the reader if the predictor scores are not nicely distributed for all groups or levels (no common support). Don’t use the standardized regression coefficients (Beta) for interaction variables, variables included in interactions, or for dummy variables in SPSS.

Watch this micro lecture on regression models with a numerical moderator for an overview of the chapter. Summary My moderator is numerical. How can I construct different regression lines for different moderator values? Chapter 8 shows us how we can include dichotomous and categorical variables as predictors and moderators in a regression model. Using dummy variables, we can analyze mean differences between groups and we can construct different regression lines for different groups (moderation). A graph showing the different regression models for different moderator groups communicates the results of a moderation model in an attractive way. What if our moderator is not dichotomous or categorical but numerical? For example, the effect of exposure to an anti-smoking campaign on attitude towards smoking can be different for people of different age or for people who spend more time with smokers. We can include a numerical moderator in a regression model just like a dichotomous moderator. Add the predictor, the moderator, and an interaction variable, which is the product of the moderator and the predictor. If both the predictor and moderator are numerical, the interaction variable is numerical. It gives us numbers, not groups. The interpretation of an interaction effect is different if the moderator is numerical instead of dichotomous or categorical. In general, the regression coefficient of a numerical variable expresses the effect of a one unit change. For a numerical predictor, this is the predicted change in the dependent variable. For a numerical moderator, however, it is the predicted change in the effect of the predictor. The unstandardized regression coefficient for a numerical moderator, then, tells us the predicted change in the effect of the predictor for a one unit increase in the moderator. This interpretation is quite abstract and not easy to understand. It is better to visualize the regression lines for different values of the moderator. We usually draw regression lines for three interesting moderator values. The mean value of the moderator shows us the effect at a medium level of the moderator. One standard deviation below or above the mean of the moderator represent attractive low and high moderator values. Just like a model with a dichotomous or categorical moderator, the effect of a predictor that is involved in moderation is a conditional effect. In other words, it is the effect of that predictor conditioned under one particular value of the moderator, namely the value zero. Unfortunately, zero is not always a meaningful value for the moderator. If it does not exist or appears rarely on the moderator, it is better to mean-center the moderator. Mean-centering a variable changes the scores such that the mean of the original variable becomes zero on the mean-centered variable. The value zero is always meaningful for a mean-centered variable because it represents the mean score on the original variable. With a mean-centered moderator, the regression coefficient of the predictor always makes sense. Essential Analytics As in Chapter 8, we calculate an interaction variable as the product of the predictor and moderator (the Compute Variable option in the Transform menu) and we use it as one of the independent variables in a linear regression model (the Linear option in the Regression submenu). The regression coefficient of the predictor tells us how much the predicted value of the dependent variable changes for a one unit increase in the predictor score for cases that score zero on the moderator. For example, one additional unit of exposure to the campaign decreases the attitude towards smoking by (-)0.53 for people with zero contacts with smokers (Figure 9.1, red box). The cases that score zero on the moderator (here: people with zero contacts with smokers) are the reference group; zero is the reference value. Figure 9.1: SPSS table of regression effects for a model in which the effect of exposure is moderated by contact with smokers: with the original variables (left) and with the moderator mean-centered (right). It is wise to mean-center the moderator variable before we use it. To mean-center a variable, we first obtain the value of the variable’s mean with the Statistics option in the Frequencies submenu of Descriptive Statistics. Next, we use the Compute Variable option in the Transform menu to subtract this mean from the original variable. The effect of exposure on attitude changes if we mean-center the moderator variable contact (Figure 9.1, green box). People with an average number of contacts with smokers score zero on the mean-centered variable, so they are the new reference group. Among people with an average number of contacts with smokers, one additional unit of exposure decreases the predicted attitude by (-)0.31. The regression coefficient of the interaction effect (Figure 9.1, blue box) tells us how much the effect of the predictor changes if the moderator increases by one unit. One additional contact with a smoker increases the effect of exposure on attitude by 0.04, making it 0.04 less strongly negative or more strongly positive. Communicate the results of a numerical moderator in a scatterplot (Scatter/Dot in the Legacy Dialogs submenu of the Graphs menu) with regression lines for the effect of the predictor at three moderator values: the mean value of the moderator, one standard deviation below the mean and one standard deviation above the mean (Figure 9.2). Get the mean and standard deviation of the moderator variable with the Statistics option in the Frequencies submenu of Descriptive Statistics and plug these values in the regression equation along with suitable values of any covariates. Add the resulting (simple) regression equations to the scatterplot with the Reference Line from Equation option in the Options menu of the Chart Editor. Figure 9.2: Plot of the effect of exposure on attitude towards smoking for three levels of the moderator variable: contact with smokers. "],["9.1-cont-moderator-regression.html", "9.1 A Numerical Moderator", " 9.1 A Numerical Moderator With a categorical moderator, it is quite obvious for which values of the moderator we are going to calculate and depict the effect of the predictor on the dependent variable. If smoking status moderates the effect of exposure on attitude towards smoking, we will inspect a regression line for each smoking status category: smokers, former smokers, and non-smokers. But what if the moderator is a numerical variable, for example, the intensity of contact with smokers? Figure 9.3: How do contact values affect the conditional effect of exposure on attitude? People hanging around a lot with smokers may have a more positive attitude towards smoking than people who have little contact with smokers. If people whose company you value are smokers, you are less likely to condemn smoking. This is an overall effect of contact with smokers on attitude towards smoking. In addition, the anti-smoking campaign may be less effective for people who spend a lot of time with smokers. The attitude towards smoking may be stronger among people who spend more time with smokers, so it is more difficult to change the attitude. In this situation, contact with smokers decreases the effect of campaign exposure on attitude. The effect of exposure is moderated by contact with smokers. Our moderator, contact with smokers, is numerical. As a consequence, we can have an endless number of contact levels as groups for which the slope may change. This is the only difference with a categorical moderator. Other than that, we will analyze a numerical moderator in the same way as we analyzed a categorical moderator. 9.1.1 Interaction variable We need one interaction variable to include a numerical moderator in a regression model. As before, the interaction variable is the product of the predictor and the moderator. Multiply the predictor by the moderator to obtain the interaction variable. Although we have an endless number of different moderator values or “groups”, we only need one interaction variable. It represents the gradual (linear) change of the effect of the predictor for higher values of the moderator. \\[\\begin{equation} \\small \\begin{split} attitude = &amp;\\ constant + b_1*exposure + b_2*contact + b_3*exposure*contact \\\\ attitude = &amp;\\ constant + (b_1 + b_3*contact)*exposure + b_2*contact \\end{split} \\tag{9.1} \\normalsize \\end{equation}\\] To see this, it is helpful to inspect the regression equation with rearranged terms [Equation (9.1)]. Every additional contact with smokers adds \\(b_3\\) to the slope \\((b_1 + b_3*contact)\\) of the exposure effect. The addition is gradual—a little bit of additional contact with smokers changes the exposure effect a little bit—and it is linear: A unit increase in contact adds the same amount to the effect whether the effect is at a low or a high level. We can interpret the regression coefficient of the interaction effect (\\(b_3\\)) here as the predicted change in the exposure effect (slope) for a one unit difference in contact (the moderator). A positive coefficient indicates that the exposure effect is more positive (or less negative) for higher levels of contact with smokers. A negative coefficient indicates that the effect is more negative (or less positive) for people with more contacts with smokers. Note that positive and negative are used here in their mathematical meaning, not in an appreciative way. A positive effect of exposure implies a more positive attitude towards smoking. Anti-smoking campaigners probably evaluate this as a negative result. 9.1.2 Conditional effect In the presence of an interaction effect of exposure and contact, the regression coefficients for exposure and contact represent conditional effects (see Section 8.3.3), namely, the effects for cases that score zero on the other variable. Plug in zero for the moderator and you will see that all terms with a moderator drop from the equation and only \\(b_1\\) is left as the effect of exposure. \\[\\begin{equation} \\small \\begin{split} attitude = &amp;\\ constant + (b_1 + b_3*contact)*exposure + b_2*contact \\\\ attitude = &amp;\\ constant + (b_1 + b_3*0)*exposure + b_2*0 \\\\ attitude = &amp;\\ constant + b_1*exposure \\end{split} \\tag{9.2} \\normalsize \\end{equation}\\] The zero score on the moderator is the reference value for the conditional effect of the predictor. Cases that score zero on the moderator are the reference group just like cases scoring zero on all dummy variables are the reference group in a model with a categorical moderator (Section 8.1.2). 9.1.3 Mean-centering Because the effect of a predictor involved in an interaction is a conditional effect, a zero score on the moderator has a special role. It is the reference value for the effect of the predictor. For example, the effect of exposure on attitude applies to respondents with zero contacts with smokers if the regression model includes an exposure by contact interaction. If zero on the moderator is so important as a reference value, we may want to manipulate this value to ensure that it is meaningful. Figure 9.4: What happens if you mean-center the moderator variable? What if there are no people with zero contact? Then, the interpretation of the regression coefficient \\(b_1\\) for exposure does not make sense. In this situation, it is better to mean-center the moderator (contact) before you add it to the regression equation and before you calculate the interaction variable. To mean-center a variable, you subtract the variable’s mean from all scores on the variable. As a result, a mean score on the original variable becomes a zero score on the mean-centered variable. \\[\\begin{equation*} \\small contactcentered = contact - mean(contact) \\normalsize \\end{equation*}\\] Mean-centering shifts the values of a variable such that the mean of the new variable becomes zero (Figure 9.5). Below-average values on the original variable are negative on a mean-centered variable and above-average values are positive. The shape of the distribution remains the same. Figure 9.5: Histograms of the original contacts with smokers variable and the mean-centered variable. The red lines represent the means. With mean-centered numerical moderators, a conditional effect in the presence of interaction always makes sense. It is the effect of the predictor for respondents who have an average score on the moderator because they score zero on the mean-centered variable. An average score always falls within the range of scores that actually occur. If we mean-center the moderator variable contact with smokers, the regression coefficient \\(b_1\\) for exposure expresses the effect of exposure on attitude for people with average contacts with smokers. This makes sense. Remember that the interaction variable is the product of the predictor and moderator (Section 8.3.2). If any or both of these are mean-centered, you should multiply the mean-centered variable(s) to create the interaction variable. 9.1.4 Symmetry of predictor and moderator If we want to interpret the conditional effect of contact on attitude (\\(b_2\\)), we must realize that this is the effect for people who score zero on the exposure variable if the exposure by contact interaction is included in the regression model. This is clear if we rearrange the regression equation as in Equation (9.3). \\[\\begin{equation} \\small \\begin{split} attitude = &amp;\\ constant + b_1*exposure + b_2*contact + b_3*exposure*contact \\\\ attitude = &amp;\\ constant + b_1*exposure + (b_2 + b_3*exposure)*contact \\\\ attitude = &amp;\\ constant + b_1*0 + (b_2 + b_3*0)*contact \\\\ attitude = &amp;\\ constant + b_2*contact \\end{split} \\tag{9.3} \\normalsize \\end{equation}\\] But wait a minute, this is what we would do if contact was the predictor and exposure the moderator. That is a completely different situation, is it not? No, technically it does not make a difference which variable is the predictor and which is the moderator (Figure 9.6). The predictor and moderator are symmetric. The difference is only in our theoretical expectations and in our interpretation. Figure 9.6: Two conceptual diagrams of moderation for the same interaction effect. For example, let us assume that the regression coefficient of the interaction effect of exposure and contact is 0.2. We can interpret this regression coefficient with contact as moderator and exposure as predictor: An additional unit of contact with smokers increases the effect of exposure on attitude by 0.2. But we can also interpret it with exposure as moderator and contact as predictor: An additional unit of exposure increases the effect of contact with smokers on attitude by 0.2. The conditional effect of the moderator, as stated above, is the effect of the moderator if the predictor is zero. This interpretation makes sense only if there are cases with zero scores on the predictor. In the current example, the scores on exposure range from 0 to 10, so zero exposure is meaningful. But it represents a borderline score with perhaps a very atypical effect of contact on attitude or few observations. For these reasons, it is recommended to mean-center both the predictor and moderator if they are numerical. In case of a dichotomous or categorical moderator (Section 8.3), the predictor can also be mean-centered. 9.1.5 Visualization of the interaction effect It can be quite tricky to interpret regression coefficients in a regression model that contains interaction effects. The safest strategy is to draw regression lines for different values of the moderator. But what are interesting values if the moderator is numerical? Figure 9.7: Which moderator values are helpful for visualizing moderation? As we have seen in Section 9.1.1, the regression coefficient of an interaction effect with a numerical moderator can be directly interpreted. It represents the predicted difference in the unstandardized effect size for a one unit increase in the moderator. For example, one more contact with a smoker increases the exposure effect by 0.04. The size of the interaction effect tells us the moderation trend, for instance, people who are more around smokers tend to be less opposed to smoking if they are exposed to the anti-smoking campaign. But we do not know how much an anti-smoking attitude is fostered by exposure to a campaign and whether exposure to the campaign increases anti-smoking attitude for everyone. Perhaps, people hanging out with smokers a lot may even get a more positive attitude towards smoking from campaign exposure. We can be more specific about exposure effects at different levels of contact with smokers if we pick some interesting values of the moderator and calculate the conditional effects at these levels. The minimum or maximum values of the moderator are usually not very interesting. We tend to have few observations for these values, so our confidence in the estimated effect at that level is low. Instead, the values one standard deviation below and above the mean of the moderator are popular values to be picked. One standard deviation below the mean (M - SD) indicates a low value, the mean (M) indicates a central value, and one standard deviation above the mean (M + SD) indicates a high value. 9.1.6 Statistical inference on conditional effects Table 9.1: Predicting attitude towards smoking: regression analysis results with exposure and contact mean-centered. B Std. Error Beta t Sig. Lower Bound Upper Bound (Constant) 0.169 0.204 0.825 0.412 -0.238 0.575 Exposure (mean-centered) -0.174 0.063 -0.308 -2.740 0.008 -0.300 -0.048 Contact (mean-centered) 0.159 0.094 0.188 1.685 0.096 -0.029 0.347 Status (smoker) 0.533 0.405 0.131 1.318 0.191 -0.272 1.338 Exposure*Contact (mean-centered) 0.018 0.034 0.063 0.533 0.595 -0.049 0.085 The regression model yields a p value and confidence interval for the predictor at the reference value of the moderator. In the model estimated in Table 9.1, for instance, we obtain a p value of 0.008 and a 95% confidence interval of [-0.30, -0.05] for the effect of exposure on attitude. This is the conditional effect of exposure on attitude for cases that score zero on the moderator variable (contact with smokers). If the moderator variable contact is mean-centered, the p value tests the null hypothesis that the effect of exposure is zero for people who have average contact with smokers. The confidence interval tells us that the effect of exposure on attitude for people with average contacts with smokers in the population ranges between -0.30 and -0.05 with 95% confidence. If the moderator is not mean-centered, the results apply to people who have no contact with smokers. Note that mean-centering of the moderator changes, so to speak, the regression line that we test. Instead of testing the effect of exposure for people with no smoker contact, we test the effect for people with average contact with smokers if the moderator is mean-centered. If we would like to get the p value or confidence interval for the regression line at one standard deviation above (or below) the mean, we have to center the moderator at that value before we estimate the regression model. In this course, however, we will not do so. 9.1.7 Common support In Section 8.3.6, we checked the support of the predictor in the data for different groups of the moderator. The basic idea is that we can only sensibly estimate and interpret a conditional effect at a moderator level if we have observations over the entire range of the predictor. For each moderator group, we checked the distribution of the predictor. With a numerical moderator we can also do this if we group moderator scores. Hainmueller et al. (2016) recommend creating three groups, each containing one third of all observations. These low, medium, and high groups correspond more or less with the minus one standard deviation/mean/plus one standard deviation values that we used for visualizing and testing conditional effects. Create a histogram for the predictor in each of these groups to check common support of moderation in the data, as explained in micro lecture 8.26. Figure 9.8: Common support of the predictor variable (exposure) at three levels of the moderator variable (contact). According to Figure 9.8, the predictor variable exposure covers the entire range from 0 to 10 at medium and high contact levels. At low contact level, however, the lowest exposure score is 1 instead of zero. In all, we have common support for moderation of the exposure effect by contact for exposure scores from 1 to 10. This is quite a broad range but we should note that we have few observations of low exposure at the low contact level as well as few observations of high exposure at the high contact level. 9.1.8 Assumptions The general assumptions for regression analysis (Section 8.1.4) also apply to a regression model with a moderator (interaction effect). The checks are the same: See if the residuals are more or less normally distributed and check the residuals by predicted values plot. Note that the linearity assumption also applies to the interaction effect. If the interaction effect is positive, the exposure (predictor) effect must be higher for higher values of contact with smokers (moderator). More precisely, a unit difference on the moderator should result in a fixed increase (or decrease) of the effect of the predictor. You may have noticed this linear change in the effect size in Figure 9.3 at the beginning of this section on numerical moderators. It is difficult to check this assumption, so let us not pursue this here. Just remember that the interaction effect is assumed to be linear: a gradually increasing or decreasing effect of the predictor at higher moderator values. 9.1.9 Higher-order interaction effects An interaction effect with one moderator, whether numerical or categorical, is called first-order interaction or two-way interaction. It is possible to have a moderated effect that is moderated itself by a second moderator. For example, the change in the exposure effect due to a person’s contact with smokers may be different for smokers than for non-smokers. This is called a second-order interaction or three-way interaction. We can include more moderators, yielding even higher-order interactions, such as three or four moderators. An interaction variable that is the product of the predictor and two moderators can be used to include a second-order interaction in a regression model. If you include a second-order interaction, you must also include the effects of the variables involved in the interaction as well as all first-order interactions among these variables in the regression model. All in all, these models become very complicated to interpret and they are beyond the scope of the current course. "],["9.2-reportmoderation.html", "9.2 Reporting Regression Results", " 9.2 Reporting Regression Results If we report a regression model, we first present the significance test and predictive power of the entire regression model. We may report that the regression model is statistically significant, F (7, 142) = 28.64, p &lt; 0.001, so the regression model very likely helps to predict attitude towards smoking in the population. How well does the regression model predict attitude towards smoking? The effect size of a regression model or its predictive power is summarized by \\(R^2\\) (R Square), which is the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable scores (attitude towards smoking) that can be predicted with the regression model. In this example, \\(R^2\\) is 0.59, so the regression model predicts 59% of the variance in attitude towards smoking among the respondents. In communication research, \\(R^2\\) is usually smaller. \\(R^2\\) tells us how well the regression model predicts the dependent variable in the sample. Every predictor that we add to the regression model helps to predict results in the sample even if the predictor does not help to predict the dependent variable in the population. For a better idea of the predictive power of the regression model in the population, we may use Adjusted R Square. Adjusted R Square is usually slightly lower than R Square. In the example, Adjusted R Square is 0.56 (not reported in Table 9.2). Table 9.2: Predicting attitude towards smoking with smoking status and contact with smokers as moderators. Results in APA style.

As a next step, we discuss the size, statistical significance, and confidence intervals of the regression coefficients. If a predictor is involved in one or more interaction effects, we must be very clear about the reference value or reference group to which the effect applies. In the example below, non-smokers are the reference group on the smoking status variable because they are not represented by a dummy variable. Average number of contacts with smokers is the reference value on the contact variable because this variable is mean-centered. Exposure, in our example, has a negative predictive effect on attitude towards smoking (b = -0.18) for non-smokers with average contacts with smokers, t = -4.37, p &lt; .001, 95% CI [-0.26, -0.10]. Note that SPSS does not report the degrees of freedom for the t test on a regression coefficient, so we cannot report them. Instead of presenting the numerical results in the text, we may summarize them in an APA style table, such as Table 9.2. Note that t and p values are not reported in this table, the focus is on the confidence intervals. The significance level is indicated by stars. A sizable and statistically significant interaction effect signals that an effect is moderated. In the example reported in Table 9.2, the effect of exposure on attitude seems to be moderated by contact with smokers (b = 0.06, p &lt; .001) and by smoking status (b = -0.20, p = 0.003 for former smoker). Figure 9.9: Conceptual diagram of the estimated moderation model. The regression coefficients for interaction effects must be interpreted as effect differences. For a categorical moderator, the coefficient describes the effect size difference between the category represented by the dummy variable and the reference group. The negative effect of exposure is stronger for former smokers than for the reference group non-smokers. The average difference is -0.20. For a numerical moderator, we can interpret the general pattern reflected by the interaction effect. A positive interaction effect, such as 0.06 for the interaction between exposure and smoker contact, signals that the effect of exposure is more strongly positive or less strongly negative at higher levels of contact with smokers. This interpretation in terms of effect differences remains difficult to understand. It is recommended to select some interesting values for the moderator and report the size of the effect for each value. For a categorical moderator, each category is of interest. For a numerical moderator, the mean and one standard deviation below and above the mean are usually interesting values. The regression coefficients show whether the effect is positive, negative, or nearly zero at different values of the moderator. Visualize the regression lines for different values of the moderator in addition to presenting the numerical results. If the regression model contains covariates, mention the values that you have used for the covariates. Select one of the categories for a categorical covariate. For numerical covariates, the mean is a good choice. If you are working with mean-centered predictors, be sure to use the mean-centered predictor for the horizontal axis (as in Figure 9.10), not the original predictor. Figure 9.10: The effect of exposure on attitude towards smoking. Left: Effects for groups with different smoking status (at average contact with smokers). Right: Effects at different levels of contact with smokers (effects for non-smokers). The left panel in Figure 9.10 clearly shows that the effect of exposure on attitude is more or less the same for non-smokers and smokers. The effect is different for former smokers, for whom the exposure effect is more strongly negative. It is more difficult to communicate this conclusion with the table of regression coefficients. Check that the predictor has good support at the selected values of the moderator. In the left-hand plot of Figure 9.10, the groups (colours) vary nicely over the entire range of the predictor exposure, so that is okay. We need histograms to check common support for the right-hand plot. Do not report that common support of the predictor at different moderator values is good. If it is bad, warn the reader that we cannot fully trust the estimated moderation because we do not have a nice range of predictor values within each level of the moderator. If the predictor is supported only within a restricted range, you may report this range. Finally, inspect the residual plots but do not include them in the report. Warn the reader if the assumptions of the linear regression model have not been met. Do not mention the assumptions if they have been met.

An interaction variable is the product of the predictor and moderator. The effect of the predictor in a model with an interaction variable does not represent a main or average effect. It is a conditional effect: The effect for cases that score zero on the moderator. The same applies to the effect of the moderator, which is the conditional effect for cases scoring zero on the predictor. The unstandardized regression coefficient of the interaction variable specifies the predicted change in the effect of the predictor on the dependent variable for a one unit increase in the moderator variable. We recommend to mean-center a numerical moderator and a numerical predictor that are involved in an interaction effect. Observations with a mean score on the moderator are a substantively interesting reference group. To interpret moderation, describe the effects (slopes, unstandardized regression coefficients) and visualize the regression lines for some interesting levels of the moderator, such as the mean and one standard deviation below or above the mean. "],["10-confounder.html", "Chapter 10 Regression Analysis And Confounders", " Chapter 10 Regression Analysis And Confounders Key concepts: partial effect, statistically controlling for effects of other predictors, indirect correlation, confounders, suppression and suppressor, spuriousness and reinforcer. Watch this micro lecture on confounders for an overview of the chapter. Summary What happens if I use more than one predictor in a regression model? And do variables matter that are not in the regression model? If we analyze the effects of two or more predictors on a dependent variable in a regression model, the effect of a predictor is adjusted for the effects of other predictors. Each predictor only predicts the part of the scores on the dependent variable that cannot be predicted by the other predictors. If we predict newspaper reading time, for example, from age and interest in politics, age predicts the part of newspaper reading time that interest in politics cannot predict. Because the effects of predictors are adjusted for the effects of other predictors, the effects of predictors may change if a new predictor is added to a regression model. The effects can become stronger (the new variable was a suppressor) or weaker and even change direction (the new variable was a reinforcer). For example, adding respondents’ news site use to the regression model predicting newspaper reading time from age may change the effect of age on newspaper reading time. Indirect correlations play a central role here: the correlation between a predictor (age) and the dependent variable (newspaper reading time) due to a third variable (news site use) that is correlated both with the predictor and the dependent variable. The size of the indirect correlation is the product of the correlation between the predictor (age) and third variable (news site use) and the correlation between the third variable (news site use) and the dependent variable (newspaper reading time). Essential Analytics We can detect confounders by adding each independent variable as a separate Block in a linear regression model (the Linear option in the Regression submenu). The SPSS output estimates a regression model for each block (Figure 10.1). Figure 10.1: SPSS table of regression models with the independent variables interest in politics, age, and news site use added one by one. In the first model, interest in politics is the only predictor. One additional unit of interest in politics adds 1.13 to the predicted newspaper time per day (Figure 10.1, red box). If age is added as a predictor in the second model, the effect of interest in politics decreases from 1.13 to 0.32 (Figure 10.1, green box). Age reinforced the effect of interest in politics in the first model. The third model adds the predictor variable news site use. Now, the effect of interest in politics increases from 0.32 to 0.53 (Figure 10.1, blue box); news site use suppressed the effect of interest in politics in the second model. "],["10.1-controlling.html", "10.1 Controlling for Effects of Other Predictors", " 10.1 Controlling for Effects of Other Predictors In a regression model, we use the variation in scores on independent variables to predict the variation of scores on the dependent variable: Does a person with a higher score on an independent variable also have a higher score or, on the contrary, a lower score on the dependent variable? A simple regression model contains only one independent variable but a multiple regression model includes more than one. For example, European citizens who are more interested in politics spend more time on reading newspapers and so do citizens who are older. We have two independent variables (interest in politics and age) to predict the dependent variable (newspaper reading time). The two independent variables can be correlated: Older citizens tend to be more interested in politics. How does the regression model decide which independent variable is responsible for which part of the variation in the dependent variable? Figure 10.2: How do regression coefficients change if new predictors for reading time are added to the model? 10.1.1 Partial effect How does a multiple regression model control the effect of an independent variable for the effects of all other independent variables? Conceptually, the regression model first removes the variation in the dependent variable that is predicted by all other independent variables. Then it determines how well the remaining independent variable predicts the variation that is left (residual variation). This is the variation in outcome scores that can be predicted by this particular independent variable but not by any of the other independent variables in the model. In this sense, a regression coefficient in a multiple regression model expresses the unique contribution of a variable to the prediction of the dependent variable. It is the contribution to the prediction of the dependent variable over and above the predictions that we can make with all other independent variables in the model. This is called a partial effect. This is what we mean if we say that we are controlling for all other independent variables in our interpretation of a regression model. 10.1.2 Confounding variables It is important to note that the effect is only unique in comparison to the other independent variables that are included in the model. It may well be that we did not include variables in the model that are actually responsible for part of the effects that are attributed to the independent variables in the model. Such left-out variables are called confounding variables or, for short, confounders. If we include a confounder as a new independent variable in the model, the partial effects of other independent variables in the model change. In Figure 10.2, for instance, this happens if you add news site use to a model containing age as a predictor for newspaper reading time. The effects of other independent variables are adjusted to a new situation, namely a situation with news site use as a new independent variable. News site use helps to predict variation in the dependent variable, so the variation left to be explained by age changes. In Section 10.3, we will learn that regression coefficients can increase and decrease if confounders are included in the model. If we want to interpret regression coefficients as causal effects, for example, whether news site use causes people to spend less time on reading newspapers, we must ensure that there are no important confounders. We will discuss this in Chapter 11 (Section 11.1.1). "],["10.2-indirectcorrelation.html", "10.2 Indirect Correlation", " 10.2 Indirect Correlation Figure 10.3: What happens to the regression coefficient for the effect of political interest if we add a confounder to the model? Numbers represent correlations (lines) or standardized regression coefficients (arrows). When is a variable a confounder and when does it change the effect of another predictor a lot if it is added to the regression model? The answer to the first part of this question is easy: A confounder is a variable that is correlated with both the predictor and dependent variable but is not (yet) included in the regression model. Because of the correlations, a confounder establishes an indirect correlation between the predictor and dependent variable. A confounder is a variable that is correlated with both the predictor and dependent variable but is not included in the regression model. The size of the indirect correlation equals the product of the correlation between confounder and predictor and the correlation between confounder and dependent variable. In Figure 10.3, the correlation between age and political interest is .12 and the correlation between age and newspaper reading time is .88, the indirect correlation between interest in politics and reading time established by age is .12 * .88 = .11. 10.2.1 Indirect correlation and size of confounding In Figure 10.3, we start with a simple regression model with political interest as the only predictor of newspaper reading time. Respondent’s age, however, is correlated both with political interest (\\(r\\) = 0.12) and with newspaper reading time (\\(r\\) = 0.88). Age creates a positive indirect correlation between political interest and reading time. As long as age is not included in the regression model, the model believes that the indirect correlation due to age is part of the effect of political interest. It assigns the indirect correlation due to age to the effect of political interest, that is, it includes the indirect correlation in the regression coefficient of political interest. In this situation, the regression coefficient for political interest expresses both the effect of political interest itself and the effect of age (the confounder). Once we add age as a new predictor to the regression model, the indirect correlation due to age is removed from the effect of political interest. The effect of age on newspaper reading time is now correctly assigned to age. As a result, the value of the regression coefficient for political interest changes if we add age as a new predictor. The size of the change is related to the size of the indirect correlation. The larger the indirect correlation, the more the regression coefficient of political interest changes if age (the former confounder) is included as a new predictor. This answers the second part of the question with which we started Section 10.2: When is a variable a stronger confounder? If you love the details: The size of the change in the standardized regression coefficient is not exactly the same as the size of the indirect correlation. It is equal to the correlation between the confounder (age) and the predictor (political interest) times the standardized regression coefficient of the effect of the confounder (age) on the dependent variable (newspaper reading time) that controls for the effect of the predictor (political interest). 10.2.2 Confounders are not included in the regression model Finally, it is important to remember that a confounder, such as age in the present example, is a variable that is not included in our regression model. As long as it is not included, the indirect correlation between predictor (political interest) and outcome (newspaper reading time) due to the confounder (age) is not controlled for when the effect of the predictor is estimated. The estimated effect is confused (confounded) with the effect of the confounder. Once the confounder (age) is added to the regression model, however, the estimated effects are controlling for the variable formerly known as a confounder. The effects no longer partly represent the effect of the former confounder. In other words, they are no longer confounded by the effect of that variable. The former confounding variable now is a predictor or, if we are not interested in its effects, a covariate or control variable in the regression model. 10.2.3 Randomization for avoiding confounders There is a very important way to minimize the chance of having any confounders at all, namely, randomization in an experiment. Remember the example of Chapter 7, where participants saw a video clip with Angelina Jolie, George Clooney, or no celebrity endorsing a charity. The video clip with or without a celebrity endorser is the experimental treatment here. If we let chance decide which video clip a participant sees, we randomize the experimental treatment. How does this help us to avoid having confounders? The example research aimed to find out whether the celebrity endorser affects the willingness to donate to a charity. The experimental treatment (celebrity endorser video) is the independent variable or predictor variable in the model. If participants’ scores on this variable — in the example, seeing Jolie, Clooney, or no celebrity endorser — are random, the variable is expected not to correlate with any other characteristic of the participants when the experiment starts. For example, female and male participants would have the same chance to see Jolie, Clooney, or no endorser. We expect one third of all females and one third of all males to see Jolie, to see Clooney, and to see no endorser. If there is no systematic difference between females and males in this respect, participant’s experimental treatment is not correlated with sex of the participant. The same reasoning applies to every other characteristic of the participant at the start of the experiment: age, hair colour, favourite movie star, and so on. We expect that all of these participant characteristics are not correlated with the experimental treatment variable. Let us now turn to the definition of a confounder: A confounder is a variable that is correlated with both the predictor and dependent variable but is not included in the regression model. A confounder must be correlated with the predictor, which is the experimental treatment here. Thanks to experimental randomization, we expect that all participant characteristics that are not included in the experiment do not meet this criterion. There should not be any confounders! We have learned about probabilities and expectations in previous chapters. These principles also apply to experimental randomization. Even if we may expect to have equal numbers of females and males seeing Angelina Jolie in our example experiment, we can end up with more females than males seeing Jolie in our experiment due to chance. In this situation, the experimental treatment variable is correlated with the sex of the participant, so participant sex is a confounder if it is also correlated with the dependent variable (willingness to donate) and not included in the analysis. Experimental randomization does not guarantee that there are no confounders but it is our best instrument to minimize the chance of having confounders. "],["10.3-confounders.html", "10.3 Two Types of Confounders", " 10.3 Two Types of Confounders Figure 10.4: When is a regression effect too large and when is it too small due to a confounder? Numbers represent correlations (lines) or standardized regression coefficients (arrows). In the preceding section, we learned that a partial effect expressed by a regression coefficient may change if a new predictor is added to the regression model. The partial effect of a predictor changes if the added variable is a confounder: It is correlated both with the predictor and dependent variable. In other words, there is an indirect correlation between the predictor and dependent variable due to the confounding variable. The partial effect of a predictor can become stronger, weaker, or even change direction if we add a confounder to the regression model. The following sections describe the two types of confounders that are responsible for these changes: suppressors and reinforcers. 10.3.1 Suppression A predictor’s effect becomes stronger (more strongly positive or more strongly negative) if we include a confounding variable that is responsible for an indirect correlation that points in the opposite direction of the effect of the predictor in the model without the confounder. Here, the indirect correlation contradicts the effect of the predictor and as a result, the effect of the predictor is underestimated (suppressed) if the confounder is not included in the model. The confounder is a suppressor variable. If we add it to the model, it no longer suppresses the effect of the predictor, so this effect becomes stronger. There are two situations in which an indirect correlation can have the opposite sign of the effect of a predictor: The indirect correlation is negative but the effect of the predictor is positive. The indirect correlation is positive but the effect of the predictor is negative. We start with the first situation and discuss the second situation later on in this section. Figure 10.5: News site use as a confounder of the effect of interest in politics on newspaper reading time. Let us assume that political interest has a positive effect on reading newspapers. People who are more interested in politics tend to spend more time on reading newspapers than people who are less interested in politics. The use of news sites confounds this effect if it is correlated with both political interest and newspaper reading time. What happens if people interested in politics use news sites more often (positive correlation) because they offer the latest political news but using news sites decreases newspaper reading time (negative correlation) because most of the political information has already been provided by the news sites? In this situation, the indirect correlation between political interest and newspaper reading time due to news site use is negative: Positive times negative yields a negative. The indirect correlation tells us that people interested in politics use news sites more frequently but people who frequently use news sites read newspapers less often. The indirect correlation clearly contradicts the regression effect of political interest on newspaper reading time, which is positive: People who are more interested in politics spend more time on reading newspapers. If news site use is not included in the regression model, the standardized regression effect of political interest more or less adds the indirect correlation to the effect of political interest. Adding a negative amount (indirect correlation), however, is equal to subtracting this amount from the standardized regression coefficient. The positive effect of political interest on reading time is underestimated. In this example, the effect of political interest is suppressed (masked) by the confounder news site use. News site use is a suppressor variable. If we include this suppressor variable (news site use) in our regression model, we eliminate its suppression of the effect of political interest on newspaper reading time. The negative effect of news site use on reading time is now captured by the regression coefficient for the news site use predictor. The effect of political interest on newspaper reading time is now controlled for the effect of news site use; it no longer includes the indirect correlation due to news site use. In this example, the effect of political interest on newspaper reading time becomes more strongly positive. Figure 10.6: Interest in politics as a confounder of the effect of news site use on newspaper reading time. Now, let us have a look at the situation in which the indirect correlation is positive but the regression effect of the predictor is negative. Just reverse the example and make news site use the predictor and political interest the confounder. The regression effect of news site use on newspaper reading time is negative if people tend to use news sites instead of newspapers as sources of information. The indirect correlation due to political interest, however, is positive if politically interested people use news sites more and spend more time on reading newspapers. In this scenario, the negative effect of news site use on newspaper reading is underestimated if we do not control for political interest. A variable is a suppressor (1) if it is not included in the regression model and (2) it establishes an indirect correlation between predictor and dependent variable that has the opposite sign of the current effect of the predictor on the dependent variable. Suppression can have surprising effects. If the predictor’s original effect was close to zero, adding a suppressor variable to the model will strengthen the effect. An effect that we initially believed to be absent may turn out to be substantial and statistically significant. If our regression model tells us that our predictor does not have an effect, we cannot rule out that it does have an effect that is suppressed by a suppressor variable. In addition, indirect correlations due to other predictors can add so much to the original partial effect of a predictor that the standardized regression coefficient becomes higher than 1 or lower than -1. This illustrates that standardized regression coefficients are not correlations in multiple regression models because correlations can never be higher than 1 or lower than -1. In contrast, the standardized regression coefficient in a simple regression model is equal to the correlation between predictor and outcome. This is an important difference between simple and multiple regression models. 10.3.2 Reinforcement and spuriousness Adding a new predictor to a regression model may weaken the effects of other predictors or even change the direction of effects. This happens if the indirect correlation due to a confounder has the same direction (sign) as the regression effect of the predictor in the model without the confounder. Either the indirect correlation and regression effect are both positive or they are both negative. In both situations, regression effects are initially overestimated because the predictors cover part of the effect of an important variable that has not yet been added to the regression model. The part of the effect that is due to the confounding variable is called spurious. The confounding variable is called a reinforcer because it makes an effect appear more strongly positive or more strongly negative than it really is as long as the confounder has not been added to the regression model. Figure 10.7: Age as a confounder of the effect of interest in politics on newspaper reading time. As an example, the effect of political interest on newspaper reading time may include the effect of age on newspaper reading when age is not (yet) included in the regression model. If older people are more interested in politics and do more newspaper reading, age creates a positive indirect correlation between political interest and newspaper reading. If age is not included as a predictor in the regression model, the indirect correlation is attributed to the effect of interest in politics. The estimated effect is too strong. Once we include age as a predictor, the effect of political interest is cleansed of the age effect, so the effect size decreases. In Figure 10.7, age is positively correlated with both political interest and newspaper reading. But a confounder that is negatively correlated with predictor and outcome has the same impact as a confounder that is positively correlated with predictor and outcome. Political cynicism, for instance, can be negatively correlated with both interest in politics and newspaper reading time (Figure 10.8). People who are less cynical about politics are more interested in politics and spend more time on reading newspapers. As a result, it looks like political interest strongly increases newspaper reading time but higher newspaper reading time is at least partly due to less political cynicism. Similar scenarios are available if the regression effect and the indirect correlation are negative. Figure 10.8: Political cynicism as a confounder of the effect of interest in politics on newspaper reading time. As with suppression, spuriousness can have surprising results. It may happen that the entire estimated effect of a predictor is spurious. Adding a reinforcer variable to the regression model may make the entire effect of a predictor disappear. In other words, an effect that we initially thought was substantial may turn out to be too weak to be of interest. Actually, the indirect correlation between a predictor and dependent variable due to a confounding variable can be so strong that a positive effect in a model without the confounder changes into a negative effect in a model that includes the variable. Adding the reinforcer to the model, the effect of the predictor not only moves towards zero (becoming weaker), but it moves beyond zero into a negative effect. It may even move so far beyond zero that the new negative effect is stronger than the reinforced positive effect. The opposite may happen as well: An initially negative effect may become positive if a strong reinforcer variable is added to the model. This would be the case if the indirect correlation between political interest and newspaper reading time via news site use is strongly negative, resulting in a negative effect of political interest on reading time if news site use is left out of the model. Adding news site use to the model may then result in a positive effect of political interest. A variable is a reinforcer (1) if it is not included in the regression model and (2) it establishes an indirect correlation between predictor and dependent variable that has the same sign as the current effect of the predictor on the dependent variable. To summarize the two types of confounders: If we add a suppressor to the model, the suppressed effect moves away from zero because suppression disappears. A positive effect becomes more strongly positive, a negative effect becomes more strongly negative. If we add a reinforcer to the model, the reinforced effect moves towards the opposite side because reinforcement disappears. A positive effect becomes less strongly positive or even negative and a negative effect becomes less strongly negative or even positive.

It is called a partial effect: It predicts variance of the dependent variable that cannot be predicted by the other predictors. If a new predictor is added to a regression model, the regression coefficient of an old predictor changes if the new predictor is correlated with both the old predictor and the dependent variable. If the old predictor’s effect becomes stronger, the new predictor was a suppressor. If it becomes weaker (the old effect was—partially—spurious) or changes direction (sign), the new predictor was a reinforcer. Random assignment of participants to experimental treatments (the independent variable/predictor in an experiment) is meant to create (near) zero correlations between the predictor and any other variable not included in the experiment. As a result, we expect that there are no confounders.

Watch this micro lecture on mediation for an overview of the chapter. Summary Can I add a causal order to the predictors in my regression models? If we add a causal order among the predictors of our regression model, we obtain a causal model or path model. The causal model includes an indirect effect: The first predictor affects the scores on the second predictor, which affects the scores on the dependent variable that we usually call the outcome variable. For example, age affects news site use, which affects newspaper reading time. In this path model, the second predictor (news site use) mediates the effect of the first predictor on the outcome variable. The second predictor is called a mediator. We can estimate a path model as a series of regression models. The size of an indirect effect equals the product of the direct effects that constitute the indirect effect. With additional software, we can estimate the confidence interval of an indirect effect. Mediation models help us to think about the different ways in which a variable may cause another variable. But we must realize that the causal order underlying the model is an assumption that we make. A regression model shows the predictive effects, which do not have to be causal. We cannot prove that the predictive effects are causal. We can only think of arguments that make a causal interpretation of a predictive effect plausible. Essential Analytics We can analyze a mediation model with a series of regression analyses in SPSS (the Linear option in the Regression submenu). We need one regression model for each variable that is predicted by one or more other variables in the model. The predicted variable is the dependent variable and as independent variables we use all variables that we think are causally prior to the dependent variable. As an alternative, we may use the PROCESS macro for SPSS. The macro requires that we distinguish between parallel mediation (each indirect effect has just one mediator) and serial mediation (at least one indirect effect includes two or more mediators). PROCESS gives us the size and bootstrapped confidence intervals for all indirect effects of the selected predictor via mediators on the final outcome variable. Figure 11.1: PROCESS output with estimated indirect and total effects of age on average newspaper reading time. Figure 11.1 shows the results of a model in which political interest and news site use mediate the effect of age on newspaper reading time. Apart from a direct effect (b = 4.55, 95%CI[3.62, 5.47], red box in Figure 11.1), three indirect effects have been estimated. Clearly the strongest indirect effect of age is the effect mediated by news site use (Figure 11.1, green boxes). An additional unit of age increases predicted newspaper reading time by 1.44. The 95% confidence interval (95%CI[0.64, 2.24], bootstrapped) does not include zero, so this indirect effect is statistically significant at the .05 significance level. "],["11.1-mediation-as-causal-process.html", "11.1 Mediation as Causal Process", " 11.1 Mediation as Causal Process Figure 11.2: How does a common cause affect regression coefficients? The values in this path diagram represent standardized regression coefficients. 11.1.1 Criteria for a causal relation Researchers are usually interested in causal effects, so let us theorize a causal order between age and reading newspapers. From previous research and personal experience, we strongly suspect that older people spend more time on reading newspapers than young people. In statistical language, we expect a positive correlation between age and newspaper reading time. Can age be a cause of current newspaper reading? Correlation is the first criterion. A causal relation implies correlation or another type of statistical association. If newspaper reading is not correlated with age, it is hard to imagine that age affects newspaper reading. But correlation does not imply causation, as the saying goes. Correlated variables do not have to be causally related. We need additional arguments to add plausibility to a causal relation. The second criterion is the time order between cause and consequence. A cause must appear before the consequence. In our example, a person’s age must be fixed before she displays the behaviour that we want to explain, namely reading newspapers. The time order is very plausible here because age stands for the moment a person was born, which must be prior in time to reading newspapers. If there is a causal relation between age and reading newspapers, age must be the cause and newspaper reading the consequence. A third criterion for causality is that the correlation is not spurious. In Section 10.3.2, we have encountered a spurious effect as an effect that incorrectly includes the effect of a confounder (reinforcer). In the context of causality, spuriousness is linked to a confounder that is a common cause to both the assumed cause (predictor) and consequence (dependent variable). Age, for instance, can be a common cause both to having (grand)children and reading newspapers. Older people tend to have more (grand)children and they read more newspapers. If we do not control for age in a regression model predicting newspaper reading time from the number of (grand)children a person has, we may find a positive effect. This effect is probably not causal: We do not spend more time reading newspapers because we have more (grand)children. Unless we use newspaper reading to ignore our children and grandchildren when they are around. Most if not all of the effect of (grand)children on newspaper reading is spurious because it results from a common cause, namely age or the habits and opportunities represented by age. To interpret an effect that we find as causal, then, we must ensure that there are no confounding variables that are common causes to both our predictors and dependent variable. Including them as controls in the regression model is a way to solve the problem (Chapter 10). With non-experimental data, for example data on newspaper reading habits gathered in a survey, we cannot be sure that we have included all common causes in our model. In this situation, we should always keep in mind that the effects that we find may be caused by variables not included in our regression model. In an experiment, however, we can use experimental randomization to minimize the chance of having any confounders at all (Section 10.2.3). 11.1.2 Mediation as indirect effect A common cause does not have to remove the entire effect between a predictor and dependent variable. Even if part of newspaper reading is caused by age, another part can be caused by a variable related to age, for example, interest in politics. During their lifetime, people may gain more experience with politics and, for that reason, become more interested in reading about politics. This may cause them to invest more time in reading newspapers for collecting information. Not all people become more interested in politics as they grow older and their interest in politics does not have to increase regularly during all of their lifetime. The relation between age and interest in politics, therefore, will not be perfect. This allows us to technically distinguish between the effect of age and the effect of interest in politics. If we include both age and interest in politics as predictors in a regression model for newspaper reading time, the partial effect (Section 10.1.1) of interest in politics is corrected for the spurious correlation between interest in politics and newspaper reading caused by age as their common cause. The partial effect of political interest can be interpreted as causal if current interest in politics was attained before the newspaper readings that we measure (very plausible) and age is the only common cause of interest in politics and newspaper reading (highly questionable). Figure 11.3: Causal diagram for the effects of age and interest in politics on newspaper reading time. Now let us draw the causal diagram for this simple example (Figure 11.3). A causal diagram contains the names of the variables with arrows pointing from causes to consequences. The causal order of variables is represented from left to right. In Figure 11.3, the very first cause (age) is at the left, the final consequence (newspaper reading time) is at the right, and interest in politics is placed in the middle. In this layout, the arrows always point to the right. In the causal order that we theorize, age is causally prior (antecedent) to interest in politics, which is causally prior to current newspaper reading time. We have an indirect effect of age on newspaper reading by way of interest in politics. When adults grow older, they tend to be more interested in politics and because of this, they tend to spend more time on reading newspapers. We say that interest in politics mediates the effect of age on newspaper reading time. Interest in politics is a mediator, an intermediary variable, or an intervening variable in this causal diagram. A causal diagram like Figure 11.3 is also called a path diagram. Each indirect effect is a sequence of direct effects. Each direct effect is a “step” from one variable to another variable, represented by an arrow. An indirect effect, then, can be regarded as a path that we can follow to “travel” from one variable to another variable. Figure 11.4: Causal diagram for the effect of age on newspaper reading time mediated by interest in politics and news site use. An indirect effect may contain more than one step or mediator. If we include news site use in the model (Figure 11.4), we would have an indirect effect of age via interest in politics via news site use on newspaper reading time. Mediation: A causal relationship between a predictor, one or more mediators, and an outcome variable. Indirect effect: An effect in which three (or more) variables affect each other in a causal order: the predictor affects the mediator, the mediator affects another mediator or the outcome variable. 11.1.3 Causal process In our example (Figure 11.4), age has a direct effect on newspaper reading time. What does the direct effect mean? If we start thinking about why older people spend more time on reading newspapers, we soon realize that this is probably not some biological process. It is hard to believe that an ageing human body requires more newspaper reading time. The effect is more likely to be social. In the middle of the 20th century, newspapers were among the most important sources of information. A person who was born and grew up in that period is accustomed to using newspapers as main information source. For later generations, however, news sites on the internet have become important sources of information. Newspapers being less important to them, they are less oriented and accustomed to reading newspapers. This line of reasoning shows us two things. First, we discover that our common cause may actually represent different things. Age, for instance, refers to life experience in its effect on interest in politics. In contrast, it relates to the period of coming of age in its direct effect on newspaper reading time. Our second discovery is that we usually look for mediators if we want to understand a direct effect. Date of birth affects exposure to people using newspapers as information sources, which affects the habit of reading newspapers, which finally affects the time spent on reading newspapers later on. Exposure and habit are mediators here. A direct effect of age on newspaper reading represents a causal process that may contain many intermediary steps. Adding mediators to our model is a way of getting more insight in the causal process. "],["11.2-path-model-with-regression-analysis.html", "11.2 Path Model with Regression Analysis", " 11.2 Path Model with Regression Analysis Mediation or, more generally, path models can be estimated with a series of regression models. Every variable in the path diagram with at least one predictor (or incoming arrow) is a dependent variable, so for each of them, we estimate a regression model. The regression model contains all variables as predictors that may cause changes in the dependent variable. In other words, all variables that are causally prior to the outcome are used as predictors. In a well-designed causal diagram, all variables to the left of the outcome are causally prior to it. Figure 11.5: Path diagram with unstandardized effect sizes and their 95% confidence intervals. In the path diagram displayed in Figure 11.5, we would regress newspaper reading time, the final dependent variable, on age and political interest. As a next step, we would predict political interest as outcome from age. 11.2.1 Requirements We can estimate mediation and path models with regression analysis if we meet the following requirements: Each variable used as a dependent variable is numeric. This is a general requirement of a linear regression model. In a path diagram, it means that all mediators and dependent variables must be numeric. For detail lovers: Variables with only incoming arrows may be dichotomous but that requires logistic regression, which we do not discuss. Each variable used only as a predictor must be a numeric or dichotomous (dummy) variable. Again, this is a general requirement of regression models. There are no causal feedback loops. Causality must work in one direction. It must be impossible to travel from a variable back to it while following the direction of the arrows. Note that it can be difficult to assign a causal order. For example, does political interest cause (low) political cynicism or the other way around? Or are they not causally related at all? All regression models meet the assumptions for regression analysis. Check if the residuals are normally distributed, centered around zero for all levels of the predicted outcome scores, and that scores are predicted equally well at all outcome levels (see Section 8.1.4). 11.2.2 Size of indirect effects The regression results tell us the sizes and statistical significance of all direct effects on the dependent variable. Both unstandardized and standardized regression coefficients can be used to interpret effects in the usual way. But how do we obtain the size, confidence interval, and statistical significance of indirect effects? The size of an indirect effect is calculated in exactly the same way as the size of indirect correlations (Section 10.2): Just multiply the size of direct effects. This can be done with either the standardized regression coefficients or the unstandardized regression coefficients. Figure 11.6: Path diagram with unstandardized effect sizes and their 95% confidence intervals. It may sound weird that we can multiply the unstandardized regression coefficients but it really works. In Figure 11.6, for instance, the unstandardized partial effect of age (measured in tens of years) on interest in politics is 0.1. This means that an additional 10 years of life predict an average increase in interest in politics of 0.1. In its turn, interest in politics has an unstandardized effect of 0.32 on reading time (in minutes). An additional unit of interest in politics predicts an average increase in reading time of 0.32 minutes. Ten additional years of life only predict an increase of 0.1 in political interest, not a full unit increase. The predicted increase of 0.1 in political interest predicts 0.1 * 0.32 = 0.03 minutes of additional newspaper reading time. As a result, an additional ten years of life predict 0.1 * 0.32 = 0.03 minutes of additional newspaper reading time as an indirect effect via political interest. Note that the indirect effect is interpreted in terms of the measurement units of the initial predictor (age in tens of years) and the final outcome (reading time in minutes): A difference in (tens of) years predicts a difference in reading time in minutes. As a consequence, we can directly compare unstandardized indirect effect sizes of different paths between the same predictor and outcome, as we will see in Section 11.2.5. 11.2.3 Direction of indirect effects Multiplication of direct effects assigns the right direction (positive or negative) to indirect effects. In the example above, age has a positive effect on interest in politics, which has a positive effect on newspaper reading time. If age goes up, interest in politics goes up and if interest in politics goes up, reading time increases. Thus, higher age is indirectly associated with more reading time through interest in politics: Plus times plus yields a plus. 11.2.4 Parallel and serial mediation If each indirect effect in a path model contains at most one mediator, we have single mediation or parallel mediation. Figure 11.7 illustrates single and parallel mediation. Figure 11.7: Causal diagrams for single (left) and parallel mediation (right). If at least one of the indirect effects in a path model contains two or more mediators, we are dealing with serial mediation. Figure 11.8 illustrates serial mediation. It contains an indirect effect from age on reading time with two mediators: Age &gt; Political Interest &gt; News Site Use &gt; Reading Time. The distinction between parallel and serial mediation is relevant to the software (PROCESS) that we will use to estimate indirect and total effects (Section 11.5). Figure 11.8: Causal diagram for serial mediation. 11.2.5 Partial and full mediation The unstandardized direct effect and indirect effects between a predictor and outcome can be compared directly because they are all expressed in the same measurement units, namely the predicted change in the dependent variable (reading time in minutes) for a difference of one unit in the predictor (ten additional years of life) (Section 11.2.2). Because of this, we can sum the unstandardized direct and indirect effects to obtain the total unstandardized effect. With this in mind, we see that the relation between age and newspaper reading time is dominated by the positive direct effect (b = 5.99) and the positive indirect effect via news site use (b = 0.03). The remaining indirect effects are relatively small as indirect effects usually are. Summing all effects, we obtain a total effect of age on newspaper reading time around 6 (b = 6.03). A person who is ten years older but in other respects the same as another person, is predicted to spend on average 6 additional minutes on reading newspapers per day. If the direct effect of a predictor on the outcome is zero in a model with mediators, the predictor’s effect is fully mediated. This clearly is not the case in our example: There still is a substantial direct effect of age on newspaper reading time. This is what we usually encounter; it is called partial mediation. Sometimes, researchers decide that an effect is fully mediated if the direct effect is no longer statistically significant once a mediator is added to the model. This strategy is contestable because a statistically non-significant direct effect does not mean that the effect is absent (zero) in the population. It can be absent but it is much more likely to be present but just too small to be picked up by our significance test (see Chapter 6). The distinction between full and partial mediation is a little bit problematic. From a substantive point of view, we may argue that direct effects are probably always mediated. As we have seen in Section 11.1.2, a direct effect usually summarizes a causal process that consists of intermediary steps, which is mediation. We may wonder whether it makes theoretical sense to talk about unmediated effects. Do we really believe that age can directly affect newspaper reading time? If the variables that we entered in the model as mediators do not create any indirect effects, the direct effect is equal to the total effect. We may conclude that the direct effect is not mediated by the mediators that are included in the model. For example, if education, political interest, and news site use do not create indirect effects from age on newspaper reading time (Figure 11.6), we only have the direct effect of age on reading time in our model. However, this effect is very likely to be mediated by other variables that we did not include in the model. We should not conclude that the effect is unmediated because we have not found mediation yet. 11.2.6 Significance of indirect effects SPSS does not calculate the size of indirect effects for us or their confidence intervals and p values. It is easy to calculate the sizes of indirect effects, as we have seen in a preceding section: just take the product of direct effects. In contrast, it is not possible to calculate the confidence interval or p value of an indirect effect in a reliable way from the confidence intervals or p values of the direct effects (see Hayes, 2013: Section 4.4 for a detailed and critical discussion of approaches that try to calculate the p value of an indirect effect from p values of direct effects). We use bootstrapping to create the sampling distribution of the size of an indirect effect. We have learned the principles and limitations of bootstrapping in Section 2.5, so we do not have to go into details here. Suffice it to repeat that our original sample must not be too small and it must be quite representative of the population if we apply bootstrapping. Table 11.1: Bootstrap results for unstandardized indirect effects in a model with two mediators. Effect size, standard error, lower and upper levels of the 95% confidence interval. Effect Boot SE BootLLCI BootULCI Total indirect effect 1.47 .42 .62 2.25 Age - Pol. Interest - Reading Time .05 .03 .01 .14 Age - Pol. Interest - News Site Use - Reading Time -.02 .01 -.05 .00 Age - News Site Use - Reading Time 1.44 .42 .60 2.23 The confidence interval of an indirect effect can be calculated from its bootstrapped sampling distribution. Table 11.1 shows bootstrap results for the indirect effects in a model with age as predictor, newspaper reading time as dependent variable, and interest in politics and news site use as mediators. In total, there is a substantial indirect effect of age on newspaper reading time in this model. We are confident that this effect is positive [b = 1.47, 95% CI [0.62, 2.25] (bootstrapped)]. It is easy to see that the indirect effect of age via news site use on reading time is by far the most important indirect effect [b = 1.44, 95% CI [0.60, 2.23] (bootstrapped)]. On its own, it is responsible for almost the entire total indirect effect. It may happen that an indirect effect is not statistically significant (the confidence interval includes zero) whereas all direct effects that constitute the indirect effect are statistically significant. In Figure 11.9, for example, both the effect of age on political interest (b = 0.30, 95% CI [0.22, 0.38]) and the effect of political interest on reading time (b = 0.20, 95% CI [0.12, 0.28]) are statistically significant at the .05 level. The indirect effect of age via political interest on reading time, however, is not statistically significant at this level [b = 0.30 * 0.20 = 0.06, 95% CI [-0.02, 0.14], (bootstrapped)]. Figure 11.9: Causal diagram for the effects of age and interest in politics on newspaper reading time: unstandardized estimates with 95% confidence intervals. This sounds like a paradox but it should not upset you. The unstandardized indirect effect tends to be weaker than the direct effects, that is, closer to zero (for instance, see Table ??). With a weaker effect, it is more difficult to reject the null hypothesis that the effect is zero in the population. We need a larger sample to reject null hypotheses for smaller effects (see Chapter 4.1.6 on power). In this case, report that all direct effects that create the indirect effect are statistically significant, so non-significance is likely to arise from low test power rather than from absence of an indirect effect in the population. "],["11.3-mediationcovariate.html", "11.3 Controlling for Covariates", " 11.3 Controlling for Covariates We usually have theoretical reasons to expect that a variable mediates an effect, for example, that political interest mediates the effect of age on newspaper reading time. At the same time, we know that our dependent variable and perhaps our mediator may depend on other variables. Newspaper reading time, for instance, may also depend on education. In this situation, we would use the other variables as covariates (or control variables) for which we want to control statistically. Figure 11.10: Causal diagram for interest in politics as mediator between age and newspaper reading time with education as covariate. Figure 11.10 presents a model in which education is used as a covariate in a model with political interest mediating the effect of age on newspaper reading time. Education is probably causally prior to both political interest and newspaper reading time, so it is allowed to have an effect on both variables. In this way, we control for education and remove spurious correlation between political interest and newspaper reading time due to education as a common cause. If education predicts political interest and political interest predicts newspaper reading time as in Figure 11.10, political interest mediates the effect of education on newspaper reading time. We are, however, not interested in mediation in the case of a covariate, so we do not estimate or report the indirect effects of education on newspaper reading time. In the context of a mediation model, a covariate is a predictor for which we do not investigate if its effect is mediated. Note that covariates should only be allowed to have an effect on variables that can be caused by the covariate. We should not include effects of a covariate on a variable that is causally prior to it. If a covariate is a consequence rather than a cause of a mediator, it had better be used as another mediator in the model. If, for instance, political cynicism may affect newspaper reading time but it is a consequence of political interest, it should be included as a second (serial) mediator instead of as a covariate.

A path model may yield a lot of direct effects, so it is good practice to present results as a path diagram with the values of the standardized or unstandardized regression coefficients as labels to the arrows. A path model conveniently summarizes the results for the reader (Figure 11.11). Remember that we don’t use standardized regression coefficients if the predictor or a covariate is dichotomous variable or a set of dummy variables (see Section 8.1.2). Figure 11.11: Unstandardized direct effects for a path model with one mediator and two covariates. If effect mediation is central to your report, focus your presentation and interpretation on the indirect effects and compare them to the direct effects. Report the size and confidence interval of each indirect effect. If possible, add both the direct and indirect effect to a diagram such as Figure 11.11. Interpret an unstandardized indirect effect just like any unstandardized regression effect, namely, as the predicted difference in the outcome for a one unit difference in the predictor. It is usually interesting to compare the sizes of the direct and indirect effects. Is the effect predominantly mediated in the model or is only a minor part of the effect mediated in the model? Inform the reader that you bootstrapped the indirect effect and report the number of bootstrap samples and the method used for the confidence intervals (see Section 11.5). For a more elaborate discussion of reporting mediation, see Hayes (2013: 198-202).

"],["11.6-criticisms-of-mediation.html", "11.6 Criticisms of Mediation", " 11.6 Criticisms of Mediation If we think of causality, we usually think of a process in which one thing leads to another thing, which leads to something else, and so on. This is apparent if we want to explain why we think that one phenomenon causes another (see Section 11.1.2). Mediation, however, is difficult to establish with regression analysis and, as some argue, perhaps impossible to establish. 11.6.1 Causal order assumed It is paramount to note that the regression approach to mediation and path models does not tell us anything about the causal order of the variables. The causal order is purely an assumption that we make. The plausibility of the assumptions depends on how well we can justify the time order of the variables and the absence of common causes for cause-consequence pairs (see 11.1.1). 11.6.2 Time order To establish the time order of variables, we must think about the time at which the behaviours or opinions that we measure took place. This is what matters, not the time at which we measure them. We can collect information on behaviour a long time after the fact, for example by asking respondents when they started using news sites or checking internet use logs. If cause and consequence appear very closely in time, it may be difficult to argue that one variable precedes the other. This may also apply to the time at which measurement takes place. If we measure cause and consequence nearly at the same time, it can be difficult to establish the time order of the two. 11.6.3 Causality or underlying construct? For causes and consequences that appear nearly simultaneously, we should take into account that the two variables may measure the same underlying construct. Think of the way we construct a scale from items: We assume that the items measure the same underlying attitude, for instance, political cynicism. The indicators of a scale are correlated because they have a common cause, namely, the underlying attitude. But it does not make sense to interpret the correlation as a sign of mediation. One item does not trigger another item, and so on. A mediator must be theoretically and conceptually different from both the predictor and outcome. We have to provide arguments that they are really different. 11.6.4 Every effect in a path model can be confounded In Chapter 10, you learned that the estimated regression coefficients can be too small, too large, or have the wrong sign (direction) if there are confounders: variables not included in the regression model that are correlated with the predictor and outcome variable. If we analyze a path model with a series of regression models, there can be confounders for each regression model. Every estimated direct effect can be wrong. As a consequence, every indirect effect, which is the product of direct effects, can be wrong. The surest way to get rid of a confounder is adding it to the regression model. In a path model, we can add a variable that we expect to be a confounder as a covariate (Section 11.3) or as an additional mediator. If a confounder comes after the outcome variable in the causal order of the path model, it cannot be a common cause to both a predictor and the outcome variable. In this situation, the confounder can be ignored. This underlines the importance of choosing a correct causal order when we construct a path model. Unfortunately, we can never be sure about this. In practice, we do not know all confounders and we cannot include all of them in our regression models. We can minimize the risk of having confounders if we use randomization in an experiment. Section 10.2.3 explained how randomization of the experimental treatment variable helps to eliminate confounders for the effect of the experimental treatment (predictor variable) on the dependent variable. We expect that this effect is not confounded. In a path model, a mediator also serves as a predictor, so we also have to randomize the mediator variable to get correct estimates for the causal effect of the mediator on the outcome variable. With randomized predictor and mediator variables, the direct effects are probably not confounded, so the indirect effects calculated from the direct effects are also unlikely to be confounded. It is difficult to manipulate a mediator in an experiment (Bullock &amp; Ha, 2011). If we hypothesize, for example, that political interest mediates the effect of age on newspaper reading time, how can we assign a random level of political interest to a participant in an experiment? By the way, it will also be impossible to randomize participant age in this example. 11.6.5 Recommendations All in all, mediation is an intuitively simple and appealing concept. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to substantiate the claim that indirect effects in path models represent mediation. Mediation assumes causal effects and causality is difficult to establish. If you plan to investigate mediation: Justify that the mediator is theoretically and conceptually different from the predictor and outcome. Motivate the time order of variables in the model. Include variables that are likely to confound the effects of the predictor or mediator(s) in your research project and in the regression models that you are going to estimate. "],["11.7-combining-mediation-and-moderation.html", "11.7 Combining Mediation and Moderation", " 11.7 Combining Mediation and Moderation Mediation and moderation (Chapters 8 and 9) can occur in the same model. For example, the effect of age on newspaper reading time mediated by interest in politics can be different for females and males. In other words, the indirect effect is different for females and males. If the indirect effect is different for females and males, at least one of the two direct effects (predictor on mediator or mediator on dependent variable) must be different for females and males. In Figure 11.16, the direct effect of age on interest in politics is moderated and as a consequence, indirect effects including this effect are moderated. This is called moderated mediation. In this example, sex is the moderator and interest in politics is the mediator. Figure 11.16: Causal diagram for interest in politics as mediator between age and newspaper reading time with sex as moderator of the effect of age on interest in politics. Several models with more than one mediator or with moderated mediation can be estimated with PROCESS. For an overview of the models, see Appendix A in Hayes (2013). The models, however, are quite complex, so we leave them for enthusiasts. "],["11.8-take-home-points-9.html", "11.8 Take-Home Points", " 11.8 Take-Home Points A causal or path model without causal feedback loops can be estimated as a series of regression models: one regression model for each variable that has at least one predictor in the path model. Unstandardized regression coefficients, standardized regression coefficients, and correlations can be multiplied to obtain indirect effects and indirect correlations. An indirect effect is a mediated effect. Variables that are at the same time predicted and predictors in an indirect effect are called mediators, intermediary variables, or intervening variables. Statistical inference on an indirect effect—its confidence interval and significance level—requires a sampling distribution of the size of the indirect effect. This distribution can be bootstrapped with the PROCESS macro (Hayes, 2013). Mediation is an intuitively appealing concept but it is difficult to establish. A causal interpretation of a regression coefficient requires a clear time order between predictor, mediator, and dependent variable, a clear theoretical and conceptual difference between these three variables, and the inclusion of all variables that may confound the effects of the predictor and mediator(s) in the regression models. Read the little but very helpful book on the logic of causal order by James A. Davis (1985) for more information on causality and correlational analysis.

"],["formulating-statistical-hypotheses.html", "Formulating Statistical Hypotheses", " Formulating Statistical Hypotheses A research hypothesis is a statement about the empirical world that can be tested against data. Communication scientists, for instance, may hypothesize that: a television station reaches half of all households in a country, media literacy is below a particular standard (for instance, 5.5 on a 10-point scale) among children, opinions about immigrants are not equally polarized among young and old voters, the celebrity endorsing a fundraising campaign makes a difference to people’s willingness to donate, more exposure to brand advertisements increases brand awareness, and so on. As these examples illustrate, research hypotheses seldom refer to statistics such as means, proportions, variances, or correlations. Still, we need such statistics to test a hypothesis. The researcher must translate the hypothesis into a new hypothesis specifying a statistic in the population, for example, the population mean. The new hypothesis is called a statistical hypothesis. Translating the research hypothesis into a statistical hypothesis is perhaps the most creative part of statistical analysis, which is just a fancy way of saying that it is difficult to give general guidelines stating which statistic fits which research hypothesis. All we can do is give some hints. Research questions usually address shares, score levels, associations, or score variation. If a research question talks about how frequent some characteristic occurs (How many candies are yellow?) or which part has a particular characteristic (Which percentage of all candies are yellow?), we are dealing with one or two categorical variables. Here, we need a binomial, chi-squared, or exact test (see Figure 11.17). If a research question asks how high a group scores or whether one group scores higher than another group, we are dealing with score levels. The variable of central interest usually is numerical (interval or ratio measurement level) and we are concerned with mean or median scores. There is a range of tests that we can apply, depending on the number of groups that we want to compare (one, two, three or more): t tests or analysis of variance. Instead of comparing mean scores of groups, a research question about score levels can address associations between numerical variables, for example, Are heavier candies more sticky? Here, the score level on one variable (candy weight) is linked to the score level on another variable (candy stickiness). This is where we use correlations or regression analysis. Finally, a research question may address the variation of numeric scores, for example, Does the weight of yellow candies vary more strongly than the weight of red candies? Variance is the statistic that we use to measure variation in numeric scores. "],["proportions-shares.html", "Proportions: shares", " Proportions: shares A proportion is the statistic best suited to test research hypotheses addressing the share of a category or entity in the population. The hypothesis that a television station reaches half of all households in a country provides an example. All households in the country constitute the population. The share of the television station is the proportion or percentage of all households watching this television station. If we want to use a statistic, we need to know the variable and cases (units of analysis) for which the statistic must be calculated. In this example, a household does or does not watch the television station, so our variable is a dichotomy with the two categories (“No, does not watch this station”, “Yes, watches this station”) usually coded as 0 versus 1 or 1 versus 2. Each household provides an observation, namely either the score 0 or the score 1 on this variable or no score if there are missing values. To test the research hypothesis that a television station reaches half of all households in a country, we have to formulate a statistical hypothesis about the proportion—of households viewing this television station—in the population—all households in this country. For example, the researcher’s statistical hypothesis could be that the proportion in the population is 0.5. We can also be interested in more than two categories, for instance, does the television station reach the same share of all households in the north, east, south, and west of the country? This translates into a statistical hypothesis containing three or more proportions in the population. If 30% of households in the population are situated in the west, 25 % in the south and east, and 20% in the north, we would expect these proportions in the sample if all regions are equally represented. Our statistical hypothesis is actually a relative frequency distribution, such as, for instance, in Table 11.3. Table 11.3: Statistical hypothesis about four proportions as a frequency table. Region Hypothesized Proportion North 0.20 East 0.25 South 0.25 West 0.30 A test for this type of statistical hypothesis is called a one-sample chi-squared test. It is up to the researcher to specify the hypothesized proportions for all categories. This is not a simple task: What reasons do we have to expect particular values, say a region’s share of thirty per cent of all households instead of twenty-five per cent? The test is mainly used if researchers know the true proportions of the categories in the population from which they aimed to draw their sample. If we try to draw a sample from all citizens of a country, we usually know the frequency distribution of sex, age, educational level, and so on for all citizens from the national bureau of statistics. With the bureau’s information, we can test if the respondents in our sample have the same distribution with respect to sex, age, or educational level as the population from which we tried to draw the sample; just use the official population proportions in the null hypothesis. If the proportions in the sample do not differ more from the known proportions in the population than we expect based on chance, the sample is representative of the population in the statistical sense (see Section 1.2.6). As always, we use the p value of the test as the probability of obtaining our sample or a sample that is even more different from the null hypothesis, if the null hypothesis is true. Note that the null hypothesis now represents the (distribution in) the population from which we tried to draw our sample. We conclude that the sample is representative of this population in the statistical sense if we can not reject the null hypothesis, that is, if the p value is larger than .05. Not rejecting the null hypothesis means that we have sufficient probability that our sample was drawn from the population that we wanted to investigate. We can now be more confident that our sample results generalize to the population that we meant to investigate. Testing proportions in SPSS For a binomial test, see the video in Figure 12.5. A one-sample chi-squared test is explained in the video of Figure 12.6. Exercises are available in Section 12.7. "],["mean-and-median-level.html", "Mean and median: level", " Mean and median: level Research hypotheses that focus on the level of scores are usually best tested with the mean or another measure of central tendency such as the median value. For example, the hypothesis that media literacy is below a particular standard (e.g., 5.5 on a 10-point scale) among children refers to a level: the level of media literacy scores. The hypothesis probably does not argue that all children have a media literacy score below 5.5. Instead, it means to say that the overall level is below this standard. The center of the distribution offers a good indication of the general score level. For a numeric (interval or ratio measurement level) variable such as the 10-point scale in the example, the mean is a good measure of the distribution’s center. In this example, our statistical hypothesis would be that average media literacy score of all children in the population is (below) 5.5. Testing one mean or median in SPSS The one-sample t test in SPSS is explained in Figure 12.7. Exercises are available in Section 12.7. "],["variance-disagreement.html", "Variance: (dis)agreement", " Variance: (dis)agreement Although rare, research hypotheses may focus on the variation in scores rather than on score level. The hypothesis about polarization provides an example. Polarization means that we have scores well above the center and well below the center rather than all scores concentrated in the middle. If voters’ opinions about immigrants are strongly polarized, we have a lot of voters strongly in favour of admitting immigrants as well as many voters strongly opposed to admitting immigrants. For a numeric variable, the variance or standard deviation—the latter is just the square root of the former—is the appropriate statistic to test a hypothesis about polarization. The research hypothesis concerns the variation of scores in two groups, for instance, young versus old voters. The statistical hypothesis would be that the variance in opinions in the population of young voters is different from the variance in the population of old voters. Testing two variances in SPSS Instructions Figure 11.18: Levene’s F test on equal variances in SPSS. Exercises Data set voters.sav contains information about the age and attitude towards immigration among a random sample of voters. Is the attitude towards immigrants equally polarized among young (under 30) and old (30+) voters? Justify your answer with a statistical test. Use the data of Exercise 1. Create a new variable grouping voter’s age with classes 18-35, 36-65, and 66+ years. Is the attitude towards immigrants equally polarized among these three age groups in the population? Justify your answer with a statistical test. Answers Answer to Exercise 1. SPSS syntax: * Check data.

Check data: There are no impossible values on the variables. Check assumptions: There are no assumptions that we have to check for the Levene test. Interpret the results: The attitude towards immigrants is more polarized among older voters (SD = 2.06) than among young voters (SD = 1.26). The difference in variation is statistically significant, F = 4.99, p = .029. Note that SPSS does not report the (two) degrees of freedom of the F test, so we cannot report them either. SPSS, however, does report the degrees of freedom of Levene’s F test in a one-way analysis of variance. We could have used that approach here as well. Answer to Exercise 2. SPSS syntax: * Check data.

Interpret the results: The attitude towards immigrants seems to be more polarized among middle-aged (SD = 2.17) and aged voters (SD = 2.06) than among young voters (SD = 1.37). The difference in variation, however, is not statistically significant, F (2, 63) = 2.77, p = .070. This result seems to contradict the statistically significant test result that we found in Exercise 1, comparing only young to old voters. There is no contradiction, however. We merely see that the classification into groups can matter to the significance of results. "],["association-relations-between-characteristics.html", "Association: relations between characteristics", " Association: relations between characteristics Finally, research hypotheses may address the relation between two or more variables. Relations between variables are at stake if the research hypothesis states or implies that one (type of) characteristic is related to another (type of) characteristic. The statistical name for a relation between variables is association. Take, for example, an analysis of the effect of a celebrity endorser on the willingness to donate. Here, the endorser to whom a person is exposed (one characteristic) is related to this person’s willingness to donate (another characteristic). Another example: If exposure to the campaign increases willingness to donate, a person’s willingness to donate is positively related to this person’s exposure to the campaign. Score level differences Association comes in two related flavors: a difference in score level between groups or the predominance of particular combinations of scores on different variables. The relation between the endorser’s identity and willingness to donate is an example of the first flavor. All people are confronted with one of the celebrities as endorser of the fund-raising campaign. This is captured by a categorical variable: the endorsing celebrity. The categorical variable clusters people into groups: One group is confronted with Celebrity A, another group with Celebrity B, and so on. If the celebrity matters to the willingness to donate, the general level of donation willingness should be higher in the group exposed to one celebrity than in the group exposed to another celebrity. Thus, we return to statistics needed to test research hypotheses about score levels, namely measures of central tendency. If willingness to donate is a numeric variable, we can use group means to test the association between endorsing celebrity (grouping variable) and willingness to donate (score variable). The statistical hypothesis would then be that group means are not equal in the population of all people. If you closely inspect the choice diagram in Figure ??, you will see that we prefer to use a t distribution if we compare two different groups (independent-samples t test) or two repeated observations for the same group (paired-samples t test). By contrast, if we have three or more groups, we use analysis of variance with an F distribution. Comparing means in SPSS Instructions Figure 11.19: Independent samples t test on two means. Figure 11.20: Paired samples t test on two means. For an instruction and exercises on one-way analysis of variance, see Figure 7.8 and Section 7.2.

Check data: There are no impossible values on the variables. Check assumptions: Sample sizes (N = 66 and N = 77) are of sufficient size not to worry about the shape of the distribution of willingness in the population. Interpret the results: Willingness to donate at the end of the campaign is significantly higher for those who remember the campaign (M = 4.94, SD = 1.60) than for those who do not remember it (M = 4.24, SD = 1.65), t (141) = -2.57, p = .011, 95%CI[-1.24, -0.16]. Willingness is 0.16 to 1.24 points higher on a 10-point scale for those who remember the campaign. Considering the range of the scale, this is quite a small difference. Answer to Exercise 4. SPSS syntax: * Check data. FREQUENCIES VARIABLES=willing_post willing_pre /ORDER=ANALYSIS. * Paired-samples t test. T-TEST PAIRS=willing_pre WITH willing_post (PAIRED) /CRITERIA=CI(.9500) /MISSING=ANALYSIS. Check data: There are no impossible values on the two variables. Check assumptions: Sample size is sufficiently large (N = 143). Interpret the results: There is a small but statistically significant increase in the willingness to donate over the duration of the experiment (from M = 4.49, SD = 1.65 to M = 4.62, SD = 1.66), t (142) = 5.74, p &lt; .001, 95%CI[0.08; 0.17]. Average willingness to donate is 0.08 to 0.17 units higher at the end of the experiment than at the start. This is a very small difference on a 10-point scale. Combinations of scores The other flavor of association represents situations in which some combinations of scores on different variables are much more common than other combinations of scores. Think of the hypothesis that brand awareness is related to exposure to advertisements for that brand. If the hypothesis is true, people with high exposure and high brand awareness should occur much more often than people with high exposure and low brand awareness or low exposure and high brand awareness. The two variables here are exposure and brand awareness. One combination of scores on the two variables is high exposure combined with high brand awareness. This combination should be more common than high exposure combined with low brand awareness. Measures of association are statistics that put a number to the pattern in combinations of scores. The exact statistic that we use depends on the measurement level of the variables. For numerical variables, measured at the interval or ratio level, we use Pearson’s correlation coefficient or the regression coefficient. For ordinal variables with quite a lot of different scores, we use Spearman’s rank correlation. For categorical variables, measured at the nominal or ordinal level, chi-squared indicates whether variables are statistically associated. The larger chi-squared, the more likely we are to conclude that the variables are associated in the population. If variables are not associated, they are said to be statistically independent. Several measures exist that express the strength of the association between two categorical variables. We use Phi and Cramer’s V (two nominal variables, symmetric association), Goodman &amp; Kruskals tau (two nominal variables, asymmetric association), Kendalls tau-b (two categorical ordinal variables, symmetric association), and Somers’ d (two categorical ordinal variables, asymmetric association). Testing associations in SPSS Instructions Figure 11.21: Test on a correlation. Figure 11.22: Chi-squared test on a contingency table (crosstab).

Check data: There are no impossible values that must be changed into missing values. Check assumptions: Can the association be linear? If we check a scatterplot of the two variables, the points do not clearly display a curved shape. But there is one point that may distort a linear association because it is far away from the other points, namely a consumer with an exposure score near one. If the rank correlation is substantially higher than the Pearson correlation, this single observation may be responsible. Interpret the results: Brand awareness is statistically significantly associated with exposure to advertisements for the brand, r = .46, p &lt; .001.

Other assumptions will be explained in the chapter on moderation with regression analysis, so let us not pay attention to the assumptions yet.

We cannot confidently conclude that either females or males experience word of mouth more frequently. Note that a one-sided test is possible too. The p value of a one-sided exact test is .080 (one-sided) here.

In Chapter 3, we estimated population values that are plausible considering the sample that we have drawn. For instance, we looked for all plausible average weights of candies in the population using information about the weight of candies in our sample bag. This is what we do when we estimate a population value. Estimation is one of two types of statistical inference, the other being null hypothesis testing. When we estimate a population value, we do not use our previous knowledge about the world of candies or whatever other subject we are investigating. We can be completely ignorant about the phenomenon that we are investigating. This approach is not entirely in line with the conceptualization of scientific progress as an empirical cycle, in which scientists develop theories about the empirical world, test these theories against data collected from this world, and improve their theories if they are contradicted by the data (de Groot, 1969). Hypothesis testing, however, is more in line with this conceptualization of scientific progress. It requires the researcher to formulate an expectation about the population, usually called a hypothesis. If the hypothesis is based on theory and previous research, the scientist uses previous knowledge. As a next step, the researcher tests the hypothesis against data collected for this purpose. If the data contradict the hypothesis, the hypothesis is rejected and the researcher has to improve the theory. If the data does not contradict the hypothesis, it is not rejected and, for the time being, the researcher does not have to change the theory. Hypothesis testing, then, amounts to choosing one of two options: reject or not reject the hypothesis. This is a binary decision between concluding that the population is as it is described in the hypothesis, or concluding that it is not. This is quite a different approach than estimating a confidence interval as a range of plausible population values. Nevertheless, hypothesis testing and confidence intervals are tightly related as we will see later on in this chapter (Section 12.5.1). "],["12.2-statistical-tests.html", "12.2 Statistical Tests", " 12.2 Statistical Tests A statistical test determines whether a statement about a population is plausible given a sample that is drawn from this population. In essence, a statistical test answers the question: Is the sample that we have drawn sufficiently probable if the assumption about the population would be true? We need several ingredients to apply a statistical test: An assumption about a population. A criterion to decide if the assumption is sufficiently plausible. A sample from the population supplying information about the assumption A probability for the sample showing how plausible the assumption is. This section discusses these four ingredients of a statistical test. The assumption about a population is the null hypothesis of the test (Section 12.2.1). We select a significance level, usually five per cent, as criterion to decide whether the null hypothesis is sufficiently plausible or not. If it is not sufficiently plausible, we reject the null hypothesis. The values for which we reject the null hypothesis constitute the rejection region of the test (Section 12.2.2). We need a sample to test whether the assumption about the population is sufficiently plausible. Finally, we let the computer calculate a probability (p value) of drawing a sample that differs at least as much from the null hypothesis as the sample that we have drawn. If this probability is smaller than the selected significance level, the sample is in the rejection region, so we must reject the null hypothesis (Section ??). This concludes the statistical test. 12.2.1 The null hypothesis The most important statistical hypothesis is called the null hypothesis (H0). The null hypothesis specifies one value for a population statistic. We can test this statement about the population with a random sample of children drawn from the population in which we measure their media literacy. Once we have the measurements, we can calculate average media literacy in the sample. We can compare the sample average to the hypothesized average media literacy in the population. If they are not too far apart, we conclude that the null hypothesis is plausible. If they are too far apart, we don’t think the null hypothesis is plausible and we reject it. 12.2.2 Significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)), significance, rejection region, and Type I error How far apart must the sample statistic value and the hypothesized population value be to conclude that the null hypothesis is not plausible? The null hypothesis is implausible if the sample that we have drawn is among the samples that are very unlikely if the null hypothesis is true. A commonly accepted threshold value is that the sample is among the five per cent most unlikely samples. This threshold is called the significance level of the test. It is often represented by the symbol \\(\\alpha\\) (the Greek letter alpha). If our sample is among the five per cent most unlikely samples, we reject the null hypothesis and we say that the test is statistically significant. Note that we can construct a sampling distribution for the null hypothesis only if the hypothesis specifies one value for the population statistic. If we would have multiple population values in our null hypothesis, for example, average media literacy is 5.5, 5.0, or 4.5 in the population, we would have multiple sampling distributions: one for each value. This is why the null hypothesis must specify a single value. According to our null hypothesis, the population average is 5.5. If average media literacy of children in the population would really be 5.5, which average sample media literacy scores are most unlikely? We can use a hypothetical sampling distribution with 5.5 as mean value to answer this question. Average media literacy can be too low to maintain the null hypothesis that it is 5.5 in the population, but it can also be too high. The significance level of five per cent is divided into two halves of 2.5% per cent; one for each tail of the sampling distribution. Graphically speaking (Figure 4.8), the significance level cuts off a part of the left-hand tail and a part of the right-hand tail of the sampling distribution. Sample means in these tails are too unlikely to be found in a sample if the null hypothesis is true. These values constitute the rejection region of the test. If the sample statistic is in the rejection region, we reject the null hypothesis. This is the rule of the game. However, rejecting the null hypothesis does not prove that it is wrong. Perhaps, average media literacy is really 5.5 in the population, but we were so unfortunate to draw a sample of children with very low media literacy scores. This error is called a Type I error: rejecting a null hypothesis that is actually true. We don’t know whether or when we make this error. We cannot entirely avoid this error because samples can be very different from the population from which they are drawn, as we learned in Chapter 1. Thankfully, however, we know the probability that we make this error. This probability is the significance level. You should understand the exact meaning of probabilities here. A significance level of .05 allows five per cent of all possible samples to be so different from the population that we reject the null hypothesis even if it is true. In other words, if we draw many samples and decide on the null hypothesis for each sample, we would reject a true null hypothesis in five per cent of our decisions. So we have a five per cent chance of making a Type I error. We decide on that probability when we select the significance level of the test. We think that 5 percent (.05) is an acceptable probability for making this type of error. "],["12.3-null-alt.html", "12.3 Research hypothesis, alternative hypothesis, and nil hypothesis", " 12.3 Research hypothesis, alternative hypothesis, and nil hypothesis The null hypothesis is central to significance testing. If the test is statistically significant, that is, if the p value is below the significance level, we reject the null hypothesis. The alternative hypothesis covers all situations not covered by the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis stating that average media literacy in a population of children is 5.5, is paired with the alternative hypothesis stating that the average is not 5.5. In this way, we cover all possible outcomes. If we reject the null hypothesis, we say that our data lend support to the alternative hypothesis. We doubt that the null hypothesis is true. Of course, we know that we can be mistaken. There is five per cent chance that we reject a null hypothesis that is actually true (Type I error, Section 12.2.2). Rejecting the null hypothesis does not mean that this hypothesis is false or that the alternative hypothesis is true. Please, never forget this. Rejecting the null hypothesis does not mean that this hypothesis is false or that the alternative hypothesis is true. Please, never forget this. The alternative hypothesis is of interest because it usually represents the research hypothesis (but not always as some statistics textbooks would have us believe). Most of the research hypotheses in social research are alternative hypotheses because our theories tell us to expect differences or changes but not the size of differences or changes. Not knowing which precise difference or association to expect, we usually formulate the research hypothesis that there is a difference or association. Because a particular value for the difference or association cannot be specified, these research hypotheses are alternative hypotheses. The associated null hypothesis is that there is no difference or no association. It equates the population statistic to one value, namely zero. This type of null hypothesis is called a nil hypothesis or just plainly the nil. If we expect that groups have different average scores on a dependent variable, for example, willingness to donate to a charity, but we do not know how different, we test the null hypothesis that the differences between the group averages are zero (no difference) in the population. If we expect a correlation between exposure and brand awareness in the population but we have no clue about the size of the correlation, we test the null hypothesis that the population correlation coefficient (Spearman’s rho or Pearson’s correlation coefficient) or regression coefficient (\\(b\\) or \\(b^*\\)) is zero. For all measures of association, zero means that there is no association. All of these are examples of nil hypotheses because the population value is hypothesized to be zero. If the research hypothesis is the alternative hypothesis, we have to choose a value for the null hypothesis ourselves. This is very important, because the null hypothesis is actually tested. If statistical software does not report the null hypothesis that is being tested, you may assume that it equates the parameter of interest to zero (see Section 12.7 on null hypotheses in SPSS). "],["12.4-testing-a-null-hypothesis-with-a-theoretical-probability-distribution.html", "12.4 Testing a Null Hypothesis with a Theoretical Probability Distribution", " 12.4 Testing a Null Hypothesis with a Theoretical Probability Distribution The preceding sections taught us how to conduct a significance test. Formulate a null hypothesis that equates a population characteristic (parameter) to a particular value, which is a boundary value in the case of a one-sided test. Then construct a sampling distribution with the hypothesized (boundary) value as centre and use it to calculate a p value for a sample. If the p value is below the significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)), the test is statistically significant, so we reject the null hypothesis. We have not discussed yet how we construct the sampling distribution. Chapter 2 presented three ways: bootstrapping, an exact approach, and approximation of the sampling distribution with a theoretical probability distribution. The last option is the most popular, so let us discuss it first. Exact approaches and bootstrapping are discussed in the next section. A theoretical probability distribution links sample outcomes such as a sample mean to probabilities by means of a test statistic. A test statistic is named after the theoretical probability distribution to which it belongs: z for the standard-normal or z distribution, t for the t distribution, F for the F distribution and, surprise, surprise, chi-squared for the chi-squared distribution. Figure 12.1: Sample size and critical values in a one-sample t test. Figure 12.1 uses the t distribution to approximate the sampling distribution of average media literacy in a random sample of children. A test statistic is calculated from the sample statistic that we want to test, for instance, the sample proportion, mean, variance, or association, but it uses the null hypothesis as well. A test statistic more or less standardizes the difference between the sample statistic and the population value that we expect under the null hypothesis. The exact formula and calculation of a test statistic is not important to us. Just note that the test statistic is usually zero if the sample outcome is equal to the hypothesized population value. In Figure 12.1, for example, the t value of a sample with mean 5.5 is zero if the hypothesized population mean is 5.5. The larger the difference between the observed value (sample outcome) and the expected value (hypothesized population value), the more extreme the value of the test statistic, the less likely (lower p value) it is that we draw a sample with the observed outcome or an outcome even more different from the expected value, and, finally, the more likely we are to reject the null hypothesis. We reject the null hypothesis if the test statistic is in the rejection region. The value of the test statistic where the rejection region starts, is called the critical value of the test statistic. In Section 3.4, we learned that 1.96 is the critical value of z for a two-sided test at five per cent significance level in a standard-normal distribution. In a z test, then, a sample z value above 1.96 or below -1.96 indicates a statistically significant test result. Probability distributions other than the standard-normal distribution, however, do not have fixed critical values. Their critical values depend on the degrees of freedom of the test, usually abbreviated to df. The degrees of freedom of a test may depend on sample size, the number of groups that we compare, or the number of rows and columns in a contingency table. We do not have to worry about this. The t distribution is an example of a probability distribution for which the critical values depend on the degrees of freedom of the test. In this case, the degrees of freedom are determined by sample size. Larger samples have more degrees of freedom and, as a consequence, they have slightly lower critical values. For samples that are not too small the critical values of t are near 2. You may have noticed this in Figure 12.1. APA requires us to report the degrees of freedom. If SPSS reports the degrees of freedom, usually in a column with the header df, you should include the number between brackets after the name of the test statistic. If, for example, a t test has 18 degrees of freedom and the t value is 0.63, you report: t (18) = 0.63. Note that the F test statistic has two degrees of freedom, both of which should be reported (separated by a comma and a blank space), for example, F (2, 87) = 3.13. "],["12.5-testing-a-null-hypothesis-with-an-exact-approach-or-bootstrapping.html", "12.5 Testing a Null Hypothesis with an Exact Approach or Bootstrapping", " 12.5 Testing a Null Hypothesis with an Exact Approach or Bootstrapping Exact approaches calculate probabilities for discrete outcomes. In the candy example, the number of yellow candies in a sample bag of ten candies is a discrete outcome. With the binomial formula, the exact probability of zero yellow candies can be calculated, the probability of one yellow candy, two yellow candies, and so on (see Figure 12.2). Figure 12.2: Probabilities of a sample with a particular number of yellow candies if 20 per cent of the candies are yellow in the population. Let us imagine that our sample bag of ten candies contains six yellow candies and we hypothesize that twenty per cent of the candies are yellow in the population. The p value of our sample outcome (six yellow candies) sums the probabilities of drawing a sample bag with six, seven, eight, nine, or ten yellow candies from a population in which twenty per cent of the candies are yellow (our null hypothesis). The p value happens to be (around) .007 (.006 + .001 + 0 + 0 + 0). This is the right-sided p value if we assume that our hypothesis is true. With the p value, we perform the significance test as usual. The p value is well below the significance level of .05, so we reject the null hypothesis that twenty per cent of all candies in the population are yellow. The situation is slightly more complicated if we want to execute a significance test with a sampling distribution created with bootstrapping. To understand the testing procedure with bootstrapping, we first have to discuss the relation between null-hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. 12.5.1 Relation between null-hypothesis tests and confidence intervals Figure 12.3 shows media literacy scores in a random sample of children and their average media literacy score (red). The hypothesized average media literacy in the population of children is shown on the top axis. The curve represents the sampling distribution if the null hypothesis is true. Figure 12.3: How does null hypothesis significance relate to confidence intervals? Do you remember how we constructed a confidence interval in Chapter 3, Section ??? We looked for all population values for which the sample outcome is sufficiently plausible. Sufficiently plausible means that our observed sample outcome is among the sample outcomes that are closest to the population value. By convention, we use a confidence level of 95 per cent, which means that our observed sample is among the 95 per cent of all samples that have outcomes closest to the population value. But wait a minute. If the sample outcome is among the 95 per cent of samples in the middle of the sampling distribution, it is NOT among the extreme five percent of all samples. This is simply another way of saying that the observed sample outcome is not statistically significant at the five per cent significance level. A 95% confidence interval contains all null hypothesis values for which our sample outcome is not statistically significant at the 5% significance level. Confidence levels and significance levels are related. A 95% confidence interval contains all null hypotheses that would not be rejected with the current sample at the 5% significance level, two-sided. If we know the 95% confidence interval, we can immediately see if our null hypothesis must be rejected or not. If the population value in our null hypothesis lies within the 95% confidence interval, the null hypothesis is NOT rejected. The sample that we have drawn is sufficiently plausible if our null hypothesis is true. In contrast, we must reject the null hypothesis if the hypothesized population value is NOT in the 95% confidence interval. Let us assume, for example, that average media literacy in our sample is 3.0 and that the 95% confidence interval for average media literacy ranges from 1.0 to 5.0. A null hypothesis specifying 2.5 as population average must not be rejected at the five percent significance level because 2.5 is in between 1.0 and 5.0, that is, inside the 95% confidence interval. If our null hypothesis says that average media literacy in the population is 5.5, we must reject this null hypothesis because it is outside the 95% confidence interval. The null hypothesis that average media literacy in the population is 0.0 must be rejected for the same reason. Note that the hypothesized value can be too high or too low for the confidence interval, so a hypothesis test using a confidence interval is two-sided. 12.5.2 Testing a null hypothesis with bootstrapping Using the confidence interval is the easiest and sometimes the only way of testing a null hypothesis if we create the sampling distribution with bootstrapping. For instance, we may use the median as the preferred measure of central tendency rather than the mean if the distribution of scores is quite skewed and the sample is not very large. In this situation, a theoretical probability distribution for the sample median is not known, so we resort to bootstrapping. Bootstrapping creates an empirical sampling distribution: a lot of samples with a median calculated for each sample. A confidence interval can be created from this sampling distribution (see Section 3.5.3). If our null hypothesis about the population median is included in the 95% confidence interval, we do not reject the null hypothesis. Otherwise, we reject it. For the lovers of details, we add a disclaimer. A confidence interval contains all null hypotheses not rejected by our current sample if we use a normal distribution (Jerzy Neyman, 1937: 376-378), but this is not always the case if we calculate the confidence interval with the critical values of a t distribution (see, for example, Smithson, 2001) or if we use a bootstrapped confidence interval. In these cases, null hypothesis values near the interval boundaries may or may not be rejected by our current sample; we do not know. A confidence interval gives us an approximate range of null hypotheses that are not rejected by our sample rather than an exact range. "],["12.6-test-recipe-and-rules-for-reporting.html", "12.6 Test Recipe and Rules for Reporting", " 12.6 Test Recipe and Rules for Reporting Testing a null hypothesis consists of several steps, which are summarized below, much like a recipe in a cookbook. Specify the statistical hypotheses. In the first step, translate the research hypothesis into a null and alternative hypothesis. This requires choosing the right statistic for testing the research hypothesis (Section 12.2.1) and choosing between a one-sided or two-sided test if applicable (Section 4.1.14). Select the significance level of the test. Before we execute the test, we have to choose the maximum probability of rejecting the null hypothesis if it is actually true. This is the significance level of the test. We almost always select .05 (5%) as the significance level. If we have a very large sample, e.g., several thousands of cases, we may select a lower significance level, for instance, 0.01. See Chapter 4.1.6 for more details. Select how the sampling distribution is created. Are you going to use bootstrapping, an exact approach, or a theoretical probability distribution? Theoretical probability distributions are the most common choice. If you are working with statistical software, you automatically select the correct probability distribution by selecting the correct test. For example, a test on the means of two independent samples in SPSS uses the t distribution. Execute the test. Let your statistical software calculate the p value of the test and/or the value of the test statistic. It is important that this step comes after the first three steps. The first three steps should be made without knowledge of the results in the sample (see Section 12.8). Decide on the null hypothesis. Reject the null hypothesis if the p value is lower than the significance level or if the sample outcome is outside the confidence interval. Report the test results. The ultimate goal of the test is to increase our knowledge. To this end, we have to communicate our results both to fellow scientists and to the general reader who is interested in the subject of our research. "],["12.7-nullSPSS.html", "12.7 Specifying Null Hypotheses in SPSS", " 12.7 Specifying Null Hypotheses in SPSS Figure 12.4: Flow chart for selecting a test in SPSS. Statistics such as means, proportions, variances, and correlations are calculated on variables. For translating a research hypothesis into a statistical hypothesis, the researcher has to recognize the dependent and independent variables addressed by the research hypothesis and their variable types. The main distinction is between dichotomies (two groups), (other) categorical variables (three or more groups), and numerical variables. Once you have identified the variables, the flow chart in Figure 12.4 helps you to identify the right statistical test. If possible, SPSS uses a theoretical probability distribution to approximate the sampling distribution. It will select the appropriate sampling distribution. In some cases, such as a test on a contingency table with two rows and two columns, SPSS automatically includes an exact test because the theoretical approximation cannot be relied on. SPSS does not allow the user to specify the null hypothesis of a test if the test involves two or more variables. If you cannot specify the null hypothesis, SPSS uses the nil hypothesis that the population value of interest is zero. For example, SPSS tests the null hypothesis that males and females have the same average willingness to donate to a charity, that is, the mean difference is zero, if we apply an independent samples t test. Imagine that we know from previous research that females tend to score one point higher on the willingness scale than males. It would not be very interesting to reject the nil hypothesis. Instead, we would like to test the null hypothesis that the average difference between females and males is 1.00. We cannot change the null hypothesis of a t test in SPSS, but we can use the confidence interval to test this null hypothesis as explained in Section 12.5.1. In SPSS, the analyst has to specify the null hypothesis in tests on one variable, namely tests on one proportion, one mean, or one categorical variable. The following instructions explain how to do this. 12.7.1 Specify null for binomial test A proportion is the statistic best suited to test research hypotheses addressing the share of a category in the population. The hypothesis that a television station reaches half of all households in a country provides an example. All households in the country constitute the population. The share of the television station is the proportion or percentage of all households watching this television station. If we have a data set for a sample of households containing a variable indicating whether or not a household watches the television station, we can test the research hypothesis with a binomial test. The statistical null hypothesis is that the proportion of households watching the television station is 0.5 in the population. Figure 12.5: A binomial test on a single proportion in SPSS. We can also be interested in more than one category, for instance, in which regions are the households located: in the north, east, south, and west of the country? This translates into a statistical hypothesis containing two or more proportions in the population. If 30% of households in the population are situated in the west, 25 % in the south and east, and 20% in the north, we would expect these proportions in the sample if all regions are equally well-represented. Our statistical hypothesis is actually a relative frequency distribution, such as, for instance, in Table 12.1. Table 12.1: Statistical hypothesis about four proportions as a frequency table. Region Hypothesized Proportion North 0.20 East 0.25 South 0.25 West 0.30 A test for this type of statistical hypothesis is called a one-sample chi-squared test. It is up to the researcher to specify the hypothesized proportions for all categories. This is not a simple task: What reasons do we have to expect particular values, say a region’s share of thirty per cent of all households instead of twenty-five per cent? The test is mainly used if researchers know the true proportions of the categories in the population from which they aimed to draw their sample. If we try to draw a sample from all citizens of a country, we usually know the frequency distribution of sex, age, educational level, and so on for all citizens from the national bureau of statistics. With the bureau’s information, we can test if the respondents in our sample have the same distribution with respect to sex, age, or educational level as the population from which we tried to draw the sample; just use the official population proportions in the null hypothesis. If the proportions in the sample do not differ more from the known proportions in the population than we expect based on chance, the sample is representative of the population in the statistical sense (see Section 1.2.6). As always, we use the p value of the test as the probability of obtaining our sample or a sample that is even more different from the null hypothesis, if the null hypothesis is true. Note that the null hypothesis now represents the (distribution in) the population from which we tried to draw our sample. We conclude that the sample is representative of this population in the statistical sense if we can not reject the null hypothesis, that is, if the p value is larger than .05. Not rejecting the null hypothesis means that we have sufficient probability that our sample was drawn from the population that we wanted to investigate. We can now be more confident that our sample results generalize to the population that we meant to investigate. Figure 12.6: A chi-squared test on a frequency distribution in SPSS. Finally, we have the significance test on one mean, which we have used in the example of average media literacy throughout this chapter. For a numeric (interval or ratio measurement level) variable such as the 10-point scale in this example, the mean is a good measure of the distribution’s center. Our statistical hypothesis would be that average media literacy score of all children in the population is (below) 5.5. Figure 12.7: A one-sample t test in SPSS. "],["12.8-cap-chance.html", "12.8 Capitalization on Chance", " 12.8 Capitalization on Chance The relation between null hypothesis testing and confidence intervals (Section 12.5.1) may have given the impression that we can test a range of null hypotheses using just one sample and one confidence interval. For instance, we could simultaneously test the null hypotheses that average media literacy among children is 5.5, 4.5, or 3.5. Just check if these values are inside or outside the confidence interval and we are done, right? This impression is wrong. The probabilities that we calculate using one sample assume that we only apply one test to the data. If we test the original null hypothesis that average media literacy is 5.5, we run a risk of five per cent to reject the null hypothesis if the null hypothesis is true. The significance level is the probability of making a Type I error (Section 12.2.2). If we apply a second test to the same sample, for example, testing the null hypothesis that average media literacy is 4.5, we again run this risk of five per cent. The probability of not rejecting a true null hypothesis is .95, so the probability of not rejecting two true null hypotheses is .95 * .95 = 0.9025. The risk of rejecting at least one true null hypothesis in two tests is 1 - 0.9025 = .0975. This risk is dramatically higher than the significance level (.05) that we want to use. The situation becomes even worse if we do three or more tests on the same sample. The phenomenon that we are dealing with probabilities of making Type I errors that are higher (inflated Type I errors) than the significance level that we want to use, is called capitalization on chance. Applying more than one test to the same data is one way to capitalize on chance. If you do a lot of tests on the same data, you are likely to find some statistically significant results even if all null hypotheses are true. 12.8.1 Example of capitalization on chance This type of capitalization on chance may occur, for example, if we want to compare average media literacy among three groups: second, fourth, and sixth grade students. We can use a t test to test if average media literacy among fourth grade students is higher than among second grade students. We need a second t test to compare average media literacy of sixth grade students to second grade students, and a third one to compare sixth to fourth grade students. If we execute three tests, the probability of rejecting at least one true null hypothesis of no difference is much higher than five per cent if we use a significance level of five per cent for each single t test. In other words, we are more likely to obtain at least one statistically significant result than we want. 12.8.2 Correcting for capitalization on chance We can correct in several ways for this type of capitalization on chance; one such way is the Bonferroni correction. This correction divides the significance level that we use for each test by the number of tests that we do. In our example, we do three t tests on pairs of groups, so we divide the significance level of five per cent by three. The resulting significance level for each t test is .0167. If a t test’s p value is below .0167, we reject the null hypothesis, but we do not reject it otherwise. The Bonferroni correction is a rather coarse correction, which is not entirely accurate. However, it has a simple logic that directly links to the problem of capitalization on chance. Therefore, it is a good technique to help understand the problem, which is the main goal we want to attain, here. We will skip better, but more complicated alternatives to Bonferroni correction. It has been argued that we do not have to apply a correction for capitalization on chance if we specify a hypothesis beforehand for each test that we execute. Formulating hypotheses does not solve the problem of capitalization on chance. The probability of rejecting at least one true null hypothesis still increases with the number of tests that we execute. If all hypotheses and associated tests are reported ((as recommended in Wasserstein &amp; Lazar, 2016), however, the reader of the report can evaluate capitalization on chance. If one out of twenty tests at five per cent significance level turns out to be statistically significant, this is what we would expect based on chance if all null hypotheses are true. The evidence for rejecting this null hypothesis is less convincing than if only one test was applied and that test turned out to be statistically significant. 12.8.3 Specifying hypotheses afterwards Capitalization on chance occurs if we apply different tests to the same variables in the same sample. This occurs in exploratory research in which we do not specify hypotheses beforehand but try out different independent variables or different dependent variables. It occurs more strongly if we first have a look at our sample data and then formulate the hypothesis. Knowing the sample outcome, it is easy to specify a null hypothesis that will be rejected. This is plain cheating and it must be avoided at all times. "],["12.9-take-home-points-10.html", "12.9 Take-Home Points", " 12.9 Take-Home Points We use a statistical test if we want to decide on a null hypothesis: reject or not reject? The decision rules should be specified beforehand: Decide on the direction of the test (one-sided or two-sided) and the significance level. The null and alternative hypotheses always concern a population statistic. Together they cover all possible outcomes for the statistic. The null hypothesis always specifies one (boundary) value for the population statistic. We reject the null hypothesis if a test is statistically significant. This means that the probability of drawing a sample with the current or a more extreme outcome (even more inconsistent with the null hypothesis) if the null hypothesis is true (conditional probability) is below the significance level. A statistically significant test does not prove that the null hypothesis is false. We can make a Type I error: rejecting a true null hypothesis. The 95% confidence interval includes all null hypotheses that would not be rejected by our current sample in a two-sided test at five per cent significance level. It contains the population values that are not sufficiently contradicted by the sample data. The calculated p value is only correct if the data is used for no more than one null hypothesis test and the null hypothesis was formulated beforehand. If the same data is used for more null hypotheses tests, the probability of a Type I error increases. We obtain too many significant results, which is called capitalization on chance. Bullock, J.
