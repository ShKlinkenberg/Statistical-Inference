Calculate the value of the indirect correlation between political interest and reading time due to news site use in Figure \@ref(fig:mediation-confoundertypes2).

Note the negative sign of the second correlation. <p> <p> * The indirect correlation is: 0.01 \* -0.84 = -0.0084. <p> <p> * This is a very small indirect correlation. For this reason, the effect of political interest on reading time will not change much if news site use is added to the regression model.

Does news site use suppress or reinforce the effect of political interest on newspaper reading time if it is not included in the regression model? Explain why it is a suppressor or reinforcer. [<img src="icons/2answer.png" width=115px align="right">](#answer10.5.2) <p><p> <A name="answer10.5.2"></A> <p> <p> ```{block2, type='rmdanswer', echo=ch10} <p> <p> Answer to Question 2.  <p> <p>  <p> <p> * If it is not included in the regression model, news site use suppresses the effect of political interest on newspaper reading time. In other words, the effect of political interest is underestimated. If we add news site use to the model in Figure \@ref(fig:mediation-confoundertypes2), the (partial) effect of political interest is indeed (a little bit) higher than the original (simple) effect.  <p> <p> * News site use suppresses the effect because the effect of political interest and the indirect correlation have opposite signs (directions). The indirect correlation is negative (see Question 1) whereas the effect is positive (0.14). If news site use is not in the model, the simple effect of political interest includes the negative indirect correlation, which suppresses the positive effect.

If news site use has been added to the regression model, the effect of political interest on newspaper reading time is indicated as a partial effect. What does a partial effect mean?

A multiple regression model contains two or more predictors; news site use and political interest in this example. The effect of every predictor is controlled for the effect of the other predictors. <p> <p> * An effect is controlled for the effect of other predictors if the effect predicts the portion of the dependent variable that cannot be predicted by the other predictors. In everyday language, we say that it represents the predictions that are unique to this variable.

The effect of political interest on newspaper reading time becomes negative if a confounder is added to the regression model. Which confounder in Figure \@ref(fig:mediation-confoundertypes2) accomplishes this? Why does the effect of political interest becomes negative when this confounder is added?
