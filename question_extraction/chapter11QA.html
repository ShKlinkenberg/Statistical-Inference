For example, older people are more interested in politics and because they are more interested in politics, they spend more time on reading newspapers. <p> <p> * The standardized indirect effect represents the predicted difference (in standard deviations) of reading time that results from a difference in political interest that results from a difference of one standard deviation in age. <p> <p> * An indirect effect is equal to the product of the direct effects, just like an indirect correlation is the product of correlations. In the example, the value of the indirect effect is indeed equal (within rounding error) to the product of the effects of age on political interest and political interest on reading time.

Set, for instance, the correlation between political interest and reading time to 0.1, the correlation between age and political interest to 0.4 and the correlation between age and reading time to 0.25. Note that 0.4 * 0.25 = 0.1. <p> <p> * In the plot, the standardized regression coefficient for the effect of <p> <p> political interest on reading time (b~MO~) should become zero. There is no <p> <p> effect if we control for age even though the correlation is 0.1. <p> <p> * Note that the standardized regression effect of political interest on <p> <p> reading time does not have to be zero if the correlation between these two variables is zero.
