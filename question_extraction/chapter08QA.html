In this example, we are talking about average attitude towards smoking for each group defined by their smoking status. The reference group is selected with the Select reference drop-down list. <p> <p>  <p> <p> ![](figures/S8_1Q6.png) <p> <p>  <p> <p> * The unstandardized regression coefficient (_b_) tells us how much larger (positive coefficient) or smaller (negative coefficient) the mean score of a group is in comparison to the reference group. In the above figure, the regression coefficient for smokers versus non-smokers (_b_ = 4.39) is equal to the average of the non-reference group (smokers: mean = 1.40) minus the average of the reference group (non-smokers: mean = -2.99). <p> <p> * The associated _p_ value tells us how uncertain we are that there truly is a mean difference in the population.

In the initial state of Figure \@ref(fig:regression-categorical), can you tell whether the attitude of smokers is significantly different from the attitude of former smokers?

The _p_ values, then, are associated with differences between on the one hand non-smokers and on the other hand people who stopped smoking or are still smoking. The comparison between the latter two is not included. <p> <p> * It is hazardous to derive the _p_ value of the difference between two non-reference groups from the _p_ values of the differences between these groups and the reference group. Remember that a _p_ value depends on both effect size (difference between group means) and on the standard error. The latter depends, among other things, on the sample size per group. All of these aspects may vary across groups, so we cannot guess the _p_ value of the mean difference between two groups. <p> <p> * The solution is to re-estimate the regression model with one of the groups <p> <p> that you want to compare as reference group. If former smokers or smokers are the reference group, you obtain a _p_ value for the difference between former smokers and smokers. Select one of these groups in the drop-down list and there you go.

Substantive interest: Does your research focus on one particular group? If <p> <p> so, use this group as the reference group, so it is included in all <p> <p> comparisons. If, for example, the research is meant to support an anti-smoking <p> <p> campaign, the group of current smokers is probably of central interest. Make <p> <p> them your reference group. <p> <p> 2. If you expect a particular order in the group means, the group that you <p> <p> expect to be in the middle is a good choice as reference group. If, for <p> <p> example, you expect that attitude towards smoking is more positive for smokers <p> <p> than for former smokers, and the latter are more positive than people who never <p> <p> smoked, the former smokers are expected to be in the middle. If we use them as <p> <p> reference group, we can test if they are more positive than people who never <p> <p> smoked, and more negative than people who are currently smoking. If both differences are statistically significant, the difference between the highest scoring group and the lowest scoring group must also be statistically significant. <p> <p> 3. If two groups have relatively similar means in comparison to the third <p> <p> group, you may be interested to know if the relatively small difference is <p> <p> statistically significant.

The predicted attitude value for <p> <p> the left-most observation is the value at which the blue line intersects with <p> <p> the vertical red line dropping down from that observation. <p> <p> * The left-most observation is the highest predicted value because the <p> <p> regression line slopes down to the right.

The moderation of the exposure effect by smoking <p> <p> status is negative, ranging from -0.06 to -0.34 in the population (with 95% <p> <p> confidence), and it is statistically significant, *b* = -0.20, *t* = -2.79, *p* = .006, 95% CI [-0.34, -0.06]. <p> <p> * More contact with smokers is associated with a more positive attitude <p> <p> towards smoking rather than a negative attitude in the population.

The unstandardized regression coefficient for smoking status is 0.5. This is the average difference in attitude between smokers (coded '1') and non-smokers (coded '0').
