This happens if contact is 6.5. For higher values of contact as moderator, the slope of the regression line is positive. Here, more exposure leads to a more positive attitude. <p> <p> * Or have a close look at the equations. The regression coefficient of the (simple) slope of the exposure effect is zero if (_b_~1~ + _b_~3~ * contact) is zero.

Mean-centering only changes the reference values for the effects of the predictor and the moderator. It does not affect the interaction effect. <p> <p> * The coefficient for exposure now expresses the predictive effect of exposure for adults with average contact with smokers. They have more contact with smokers than the reference group in Exercise 1, who had no contact with smokers. The interaction effect tells us that the effect of exposure becomes less negative at higher levels of contact. This explains that we have a higher (less strongly negative) value for the exposure coefficient now. It still is negative, so more exposure to the anti-smoking campaign predicts a more negative attitude towards smoking for adults with average contact with smokers, *b* = -0.32, *t* = -9.77, *p* < .001, 95% CI [-0.38, -0.25]. <p> <p> * The positive effect of contact with smokers on attitude is stronger now (*b* = 0.23) than in Exercise 1 (*b* = 0.02). The interaction effect tells us that contact has a more positive effect on smoking attitude for higher levels of campaign exposure. As a result, the effect of contact at average exposure is stronger than at zero exposure. <p> <p> * Why do we have a statistical significant result for the effect of contact <p> <p> now (*p* < .001) but not in Exercise 1 (*p* = .864)? <p> <p> * Part of the answer is that the unstandardized effect is larger (*b* = 0.23) now than in Exercise 1 (*b* = 0.02). It is further away from zero so it is easier to reject the nil hypothesis. The standard error is the other part of the answer. The standard error is smaller now: *SE* = 0.05 against *SE* = 0.09 in Exercise 1. We have quite some observations with about average contact score (the reference value if we mean-center) but hardly any observations with minimum (zero) contact score. With fewer observations, we are less certain about estimates, so we have a larger standard error, and it is more difficult to be confident that the regression coefficient is not zero in the population.

There are relatively few very low (-2 to -6) predicted values, so it is hard to evaluate the variation in residuals here. <p> <p>    <p> <p> Interpret the results:   <p> <p>    <p> <p> * The regression model predicts 22 per cent of the variation in the dependent variable, *F* (4, 515) = 35.96, *p* < .001. <p> <p> * Males seem to have a slightly higher average intention to buy products of the brand than females (*b* = 0.17) but this difference is not statistically significant at the five per cent level, *t* = 1.39, *p* = .164, 95% CI [-0.07, 0.40]. We are 95% confident that the average difference in buying intention between males and females is not larger than .40 in the population, which is not much on the ten-point scale used to measure buying intention. <p> <p> * Exposure to brand advertisements has a statistically significant positive effect on buying intention for people with average brand awareness, *b* = 0.28, *t* = 6.81, *p* < .001, 95% CI [0.20, 0.36]. More exposure coincides with higher buying intention for people with average brand awareness. <p> <p> * Similarly, the effect of brand awareness on buying intention is positive (*b* = 0.12) for people with average ad exposure. This effect is statistically significant, *t* = 2.91, *p* = .004, 95% CI [0.04, 0.20]. Higher brand awareness is associated with higher intention to buy. <p> <p> * The interaction effect of ad exposure and brand awareness on buying intention is negative (*b* = -0.09) and significantly different from zero, *t* = -4.44, *p* < .001, 95% CI [-0.13, -0.05]. More ad exposure reduces the positive effect of brand awareness on buying intention and more brand awareness reduces the positive effect of ad exposure on buying intention as illustrated by the below plots. We could conclude that ad exposure seems to be more efficient at increasing buying attention for people who know the brand less well (who have lower brand awareness).

Mean-centering only changes the reference values for the effects of the predictor and the moderator. It does not affect the interaction effect. <p> <p> * The coefficient for exposure now expresses the predictive effect of exposure for adults with average contact with smokers. They have more contact with smokers than the reference group in Exercise 1, who had no contact with smokers. The interaction effect tells us that the effect of exposure becomes less negative at higher levels of contact. This explains that we have a higher (less strongly negative) value for the exposure coefficient now. It still is negative, so more exposure to the anti-smoking campaign predicts a more negative attitude towards smoking for adults with average contact with smokers, *b* = -0.32, *t* = -9.77, *p* < .001, 95% CI [-0.38, -0.25]. <p> <p> * The positive effect of contact with smokers on attitude is stronger now (*b* = 0.23) than in Exercise 1 (*b* = 0.02). The interaction effect tells us that contact has a more positive effect on smoking attitude for higher levels of campaign exposure. As a result, the effect of contact at average exposure is stronger than at zero exposure. <p> <p> * Why do we have a statistical significant result for the effect of contact <p> <p> now (*p* < .001) but not in Exercise 1 (*p* = .864)? <p> <p> * Part of the answer is that the unstandardized effect is larger (*b* = 0.23) now than in Exercise 1 (*b* = 0.02). It is further away from zero so it is easier to reject the nil hypothesis. The standard error is the other part of the answer. The standard error is smaller now: *SE* = 0.05 against *SE* = 0.09 in Exercise 1. We have quite some observations with about average contact score (the reference value if we mean-center) but hardly any observations with minimum (zero) contact score. With fewer observations, we are less certain about estimates, so we have a larger standard error, and it is more difficult to be confident that the regression coefficient is not zero in the population.

We are 95% confident that the average difference in buying intention between males and females is not larger than .40 in the population, which is not much on the ten-point scale used to measure buying intention. <p> <p> * Exposure to brand advertisements has a statistically significant positive effect on buying intention for people with average brand awareness, *b* = 0.28, *t* = 6.81, *p* < .001, 95% CI [0.20, 0.36]. More exposure coincides with higher buying intention for people with average brand awareness. <p> <p> * Similarly, the effect of brand awareness on buying intention is positive (*b* = 0.12) for people with average ad exposure. This effect is statistically significant, *t* = 2.91, *p* = .004, 95% CI [0.04, 0.20]. Higher brand awareness is associated with higher intention to buy. <p> <p> * The interaction effect of ad exposure and brand awareness on buying intention is negative (*b* = -0.09) and significantly different from zero, *t* = -4.44, *p* < .001, 95% CI [-0.13, -0.05]. More ad exposure reduces the positive effect of brand awareness on buying intention and more brand awareness reduces the positive effect of ad exposure on buying intention as illustrated by the below plots. We could conclude that ad exposure seems to be more efficient at increasing buying attention for people who know the brand less well (who have lower brand awareness).

If we want to visualize the effect of a predictor on a dependent variable for a low moderator score, we prefer to use a moderator score of one standard deviation below the mean instead of the minimum value of the moderator. Use Figure \@ref(fig:mean-centering-moderator2) to show why this is the case. Hint: common support.

Observations with contact scores near zero are blue. There are only a few of them, so we have very few observations for the regression line at this moderator value. These observations do not cover the entire range of exposure values; there are two in the center and one at the right. The regression line has bad common support. <p> <p>  <p> <p> ![](figures/S9_4Q7.png) <p> <p>  <p> <p> * If you compare the **Center Contact** slider to the **Adjust the value of Contact** slider, you can see that *M - SD* equals 3 here. Three contacts is one standard deviation below the average number of contacts.  <p> <p> * Set the **Adjust the value of Contact** slider to 3 to obtain the (blue) regression line expressing the effect of exposure on attitude for people with 3 contacts with smokers (figure above, right panel).  <p> <p> * Now we can see which observations have contact scores close to 3. There are many blue and dark blue (contact scores very close to 3) dots and they are nicely distributed across the entire range of exposure scores. This regression line has good common support; it is more reliable than the one for minimum (0) number of contacts.
