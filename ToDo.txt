To Do

1: Figure 3.3: How does sample size affect the precision of an interval estimate?

Fix the y axis to make the difference in shape and area more explicit.

2: Critical value

Chapter 3 states that the upper and lower bound of a z-distribution are called critical values.
I would argue that the term critical value should only be used in relation to NHST and not with the upper and lower bound for parameter estimation.

3.4 goes into this with grait detail.

3.5.1 Imaginary population values: This chapter is very hard to follow.

4.6.1 Relation between null-hypothesis tests and confidence intervals

5.5 Research Hypothesis as Null Hypothesis

5.3.6 Post hoc power

create a new shiny app with null distribution, and random sample with mean and alternative distribtuion and post hoc power area under the HA distribution
